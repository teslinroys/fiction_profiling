'Wot's to be
done?' "I shut the gate with a bang and fastened the wicket. Then I turned to
'im with a smile. "'I'm watchman 'ere,' I ses, 'and I lets in who I thinks I will. This
ain't a public 'ighway,' I ses; 'it's a wharf.' "'Bill,' he ses, 'you're a genius.' "'If Miss Lamb comes 'ere asking arter you,' I ses, 'I shall say you've
gone out for the evening.' "'Wot about her letter?' he ses. "'You didn't 'ave it,' I ses, winking at 'im. "'And suppose she waits about outside for me, and Mrs. Plimmer wants me
to take 'er out?' he ses, shivering. 'She's a fearful obstinate woman;
and she'd wait a week for me.' "He kept peeping up the road while we talked it over, and then we both
see Mrs. Plimmer coming along. He backed on to the wharf and pulled out
'is purse. "'Bill,' he ses, gabbling as fast as 'e could gabble, 'here's five or six
shillings. If the other one comes and won't go away tell 'er I've gone
to the Pagoda Music-'all and you'll take 'er to me, keep 'er out all the
evening some'ow, if you can, if she comes back too soon keep 'er in the
office.' "'And wot about leaving the wharf and my dooty?' I ses, staring. "'I'll put Joe on to keep watch for you,' he ses, pressing the money in
my 'and. 'I rely on you, Bill, and I'll never forget you. You won't
lose by it, trust me.' "He nipped off and tumbled aboard the ship afore I could say a word. I
just stood there staring arter 'im and feeling the money, and afore I
could make up my mind Mrs. Plimmer came up. "I thought I should never ha' got rid of 'er. She stood there chatting
and smiling, and seemed to forget all about the cap'n, and every moment I
was afraid that the other one might come up. At last she went off,
looking behind 'er, to the ship, and then I went outside and put my back
up agin the gate and waited. "I 'ad hardly been there ten minutes afore the other one came along. I
saw 'er stop and speak to a policeman, and then she came straight over to
me. "'I want to see Cap'n Tarbell,' she ses. "'Cap'n Tarbell?' I ses, very slow; 'Cap'n Tarbell 'as gone off for the
evening.' "'Gone off!' she ses, staring. 'But he can't 'ave. Are you sure?' "'Sartain,' I ses. Then I 'ad a bright idea. 'And there's a letter come
for 'im,' I ses. "'Oh, dear!' she ses. 'And I thought it would be in plenty of time. Well, I must go on the ship and wait for 'im, I suppose.' "If I 'ad only let 'er go I should ha' saved myself a lot o' trouble, and
the man wot deserved it would ha' got it. Instead o' that I told 'er
about the music-'all, and arter carrying on like a silly gal o' seventeen
and saying she couldn't think of it, she gave way and said she'd go with
me to find 'im. I was all right so far as clothes went as it happened. Mrs. Plimmer said once that I got more and more dressy every time she saw
me, and my missis 'ad said the same thing only in a different way. I
just took a peep through the wicket and saw that Joe 'ad taken up my
dooty, and then we set off. "I said I wasn't quite sure which one he'd gone to, but we'd try the
Pagoda Music-'all fust, and we went there on a bus from Aldgate. It was
the fust evening out I 'ad 'ad for years, and I should 'ave enjoyed it if
it 'adn't been for Miss Lamb. Wotever Cap'n Tarbell could ha' seen in
'er, I can't think. "She was quiet, and stupid, and bad-tempered. When the bus-conductor came
round for the fares she 'adn't got any change; and when we got to the
hall she did such eggsterrordinary things trying to find 'er pocket that
I tried to look as if she didn't belong to me. When she left off she
smiled and said she was farther off than ever, and arter three or four
wot was standing there 'ad begged 'er to have another try, I 'ad to pay
for the two. "The 'ouse was pretty full when we got in, but she didn't take no notice
of that. Her idea was that she could walk about all over the place
looking for Cap'n Tarbell, and it took three men in buttons and a
policeman to persuade 'er different. We were pushed into a couple o'
seats at last, and then she started finding fault with me. "'Where is Cap'n Tarbell?' she ses. 'Why don't you find him?' "'I'll go and look for 'im in the bar presently,' I ses. 'He's sure to
be there, arter a turn or two.' "I managed to keep 'er quiet for 'arf an hour--with the 'elp of the
people wot sat near us--and then I 'ad to go. I 'ad a glass o' beer to
pass the time away, and, while I was drinking it, who should come up but
the cook and one of the hands from the _Lizzie and Annie_. "'We saw you,' ses the cook, winking; 'didn't we Bob?' "'Yes,' ses Bob, shaking his silly 'ead; 'but it wasn't no surprise to
me. I've 'ad my eye on 'im for a long time past.' "'I thought 'e was married,' ses the cook. "'So he is,' ses Bob, 'and to the best wife in London. I know where she
lives. Mine's a bottle o' Bass,' he ses, turning to me. "'So's mine,' ses the cook. "I paid for two bottles for 'em, and arter that they said that they'd
'ave a whisky and soda apiece just to show as there was no ill-feeling. "'It's very good,' ses Bob, sipping his, 'but it wants a sixpenny cigar
to go with it. It's been the dream o' my life to smoke a sixpenny
cigar.' "'So it 'as mine,' ses the cook, 'but I don't suppose I ever shall.' "They both coughed arter that, and like a goodnatured fool I stood 'em a
sixpenny cigar apiece, and I 'ad just turned to go back to my seat when
up come two more hands from the Lizzie and Annie. "'Halloa, watchman!' ses one of 'em. 'Why, I thought you was a-taking
care of the wharf.' "'He's got something better than the wharf to take care of,' ses Bob,
grinning. "'I know; we see 'im,' ses the other chap. 'We've been watching 'is
goings-on for the last 'arf-hour; better than a play it was.' "I stopped their mouths with a glass o' bitter each, and went back to my
seat while they was drinking it. I told Miss Lamb in whispers that 'e
wasn't there, but I'd 'ave another look for him by and by. If she'd ha'
whispered back it would ha' been all right, but she wouldn't, and, arter
a most unpleasant scene, she walked out with her 'ead in the air follered
by me with two men in buttons and a policeman. "O' course, nothing would do but she must go back to the wharf and wait
for Cap'n Tarbell, and all the way there I was wondering wot would 'appen
if she went on board and found 'im there with Mrs. Plimmer. However,
when we got there I persuaded 'er to go into the office while I went
aboard to see if I could find out where he was, and three minutes
arterwards he was standing with me behind the galley, trembling all over
and patting me on the back. "'Keep 'er in the office a little longer,' he ses, in a whisper. 'The
other's going soon. Keep 'er there as long as you can.' "'And suppose she sees you and Mrs. Plimmer passing the window?' I ses. "'That'll be all right; I'm going to take 'er to the stairs in the ship's
boat,' he ses. 'It's more romantic.' "He gave me a little punch in the ribs, playfullike, and, arter telling
me I was worth my weight in gold-dust, went back to the cabin agin. "I told Miss Lamb that the cabin was locked up, but that Cap'n Tarbell
was expected back in about 'arf-an-hour's time. Then I found 'er an old
newspaper and a comfortable chair and sat down to wait. I couldn't go on
the wharf for fear she'd want to come with me, and I sat there as patient
as I could, till a little clicking noise made us both start up and look
at each other. "'Wot's that?' she ses, listening. "'It sounded,' I ses 'it sounded like somebody locking the door.' "I went to the door to try it just as somebody dashed past the window
with their 'ead down. It was locked fast, and arter I had 'ad a try at
it and Miss Lamb had 'ad a try at it, we stood and looked at each other
in surprise. "'Somebody's playing a joke on us,' I ses. "'Joke!' ses Miss Lamb. 'Open that door at once. If you don't open it
I'll call for the police.' "She looked at the windows, but the iron bars wot was strong enough to
keep the vans outside was strong enough to keep 'er in, and then she gave
way to such a fit o' temper that I couldn't do nothing with 'er. "'Cap'n Tarbell can't be long now,' I ses, as soon as I could get a word
in. 'We shall get out as soon as e comes.' "She flung 'erself down in the chair agin with 'er back to me, and for
nearly three-quarters of an hour we sat there without a word. Then, to
our joy, we 'eard footsteps turn in at the gate. Quick footsteps they
was. Somebody turned the handle of the door, and then a face looked in
at the window that made me nearly jump out of my boots in surprise. A
face that was as white as chalk with temper, and a bonnet cocked over one
eye with walking fast. She shook 'er fist at me, and then she shook it
at Miss Lamb. "'Who's that?' ses Miss Lamb. "'My missis,' I ses, in a loud voice. 'Thank goodness she's come.' "'Open the door!' ses my missis, with a screech. "'OPEN THE DOOR!' "'I can't,' I ses. 'Somebody's locked it. This is Cap'n Tarbell's young
lady.' "'I'll Cap'n Tarbell 'er when I get in!' ses my wife. 'You too. I'll
music-'all you! I'll learn you to go gallivanting about! Open the
door!' "She walked up and down the alley-way in front of the window waiting for
me just like a lion walking up and down its cage waiting for its dinner,
and I made up my mind then and there that I should 'ave to make a clean
breast of it and let Cap'n Tarbell get out of it the best way he could. I wasn't going to suffer for him. "'Ow long my missis walked up and down there I don't know. It seemed
ages to me; but at last I 'eard footsteps and voices, and Bob and the
cook and the other two chaps wot we 'ad met at the music'all came along
and stood grinning in at the window. "'Somebody's locked us in,' I ses. 'Go and fetch Cap'n Tarbell.' "'Cap'n Tarbell?' ses the cook. 'You don't want to see 'im. Why, he's
the last man in the world you ought to want to see! You don't know 'ow
jealous he is.' "'You go and fetch 'im, I ses. ''Ow dare you talk like that afore my
wife!' "'I dursen't take the responserbility,' ses the cook. 'It might mean
bloodshed.' "'You go and fetch 'im,' ses my missis. 'Never mind about the bloodshed. I don't. Open the door!' "She started banging on the door agin, and arter talking among themselves
for a time they moved off to the ship. They came back in three or four
minutes, and the cook 'eld up something in front of the window. "'The boy 'ad got it,' he ses. 'Now shall I open the door and let your
missis in, or would you rather stay where you are in peace and
quietness?' "I saw my missis jump at the key, and Bob and the others, laughing fit to
split their sides, 'olding her back. Then I heard a shout, and the next
moment Cap'n Tarbell came up and asked 'em wot the trouble was about. "They all started talking at once, and then the cap'n, arter one look in
at the window, threw up his 'ands and staggered back as if 'e couldn't
believe his eyesight. He stood dazed-like for a second or two, and then
'e took the key out of the cook's 'and, opened the door, and walked in. The four men was close be'ind 'im, and, do all she could, my missis
couldn't get in front of 'em. "'Watchman!' he ses, in a stuck-up voice, 'wot does this mean? Laura
Lamb! wot 'ave you got to say for yourself? Where 'ave you been all the
evening?' "'She's been to a music-'all with Bill,' ses the cook. 'We saw 'em.' "'WOT?' ses the cap'n, falling back again. 'It can't be!' "'It was them,' ses my wife. 'A little boy brought me a note telling me. You let me go; it's my husband, and I want to talk to 'im.' "'It's all right,' I ses, waving my 'and at Miss Lamb, wot was going to
speak, and smiling at my missis, wot was trying to get at me. "'We went to look for you,' ses Miss Lamb, very quick. 'He said you were
at the music-'all, and as you 'adn't got my letter I thought it was very
likely.'
