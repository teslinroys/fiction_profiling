They had told me he was a merry,
light-hearted youth. I saw him, with my mind's eye, on the
schooner on which he worked, wearing nothing but a pair of
dungarees; and at night, when the boat sailed along easily
before a light breeze, and the sailors were gathered on the
upper deck, while the captain and the supercargo lolled in
deck-chairs, smoking their pipes, I saw him dance with another lad,
dance wildly, to the wheezy music of the concertina. Above was the blue sky, and the stars, and all about the
desert of the Pacific Ocean. A quotation from the Bible came to my lips, but I held my tongue,
for I know that clergymen think it a little blasphemous when the
laity poach upon their preserves. My Uncle Henry, for
twenty-seven years Vicar of Whitstable, was on these occasions in
the habit of saying that the devil could always quote scripture
to his purpose. He remembered the days when you could get
thirteen Royal Natives for a shilling.
