"In the matter of your mess-jacket, sir." A nameless fear shot through me, causing me to swallow a mouthful of
omelette the wrong way. "I am sorry to say, sir, that while I was ironing it this afternoon I was
careless enough to leave the hot instrument upon it. I very much fear
that it will be impossible for you to wear it again, sir." One of those old pregnant silences filled the room. "I am extremely sorry, sir." For a moment, I confess, that generous wrath of mine came bounding back,
hitching up its muscles and snorting a bit through the nose, but, as we
say on the Riviera, _Ã  quoi sert-il_? There was nothing to be gained by
g.w. now. We Woosters can bite the bullet. I nodded moodily and speared another
slab of omelette. "Right ho, Jeeves." "Very good, sir."
