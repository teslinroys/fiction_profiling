For by this time I had learnt, that there was
a wake-rife common sense abroad among the opinions of men; and that the
secret of the new way of ruling the world was to follow, not to control,
the evident dictates of the popular voice; and I soon had reason to
felicitate myself on this prudent and seasonable discovery. For it won
me great reverence among the forward young men, who started up at the
call of their country; and their demeanour towards me was as tokens and
arles, from the rising generation, of being continued in respect and
authority by them. Some of my colleagues, who are as well not named, by
making themselves over busy, got but small thank for their pains. I was
even preferred to the provost, as the medium of communicating the
sentiments of the volunteering lads to the lord-lieutenant; and their
cause did not suffer in my hands, for his lordship had long been in the
habit of considering me as one of the discreetest men in the burgh; and
although he returned very civil answers to all letters, he wrote to me in
the cordial erudition of an old friend--a thing which the volunteers soon
discerned, and respected me accordingly. But the soldiering zeal being spontaneous among all ranks, and breaking
forth into ablaze without any pre-ordered method, some of the magistrates
were disconcerted, and wist not what to do. I'll no take it upon me to
say that they were altogether guided by a desire to have a finger in the
pie, either in the shape of the honours of command or the profits of
contract. This, however, is certain, that they either felt or feigned a
great alarm and consternation at seeing such a vast military power in
civil hands, over which they had no natural control; and, as was said,
independent of the crown and parliament. Another thing there could be no
doubt of: in the frame of this fear they remonstrated with the
government, and counselled the ministers to throw a wet blanket on the
ardour of the volunteering, which, it is well known, was very readily
done; for the ministers, on seeing such a pressing forward to join the
banners of the kingdom, had a dread and regard to the old leaven of
Jacobinism, and put a limitation on the number of the armed men that were
to be allowed to rise in every place--a most ill-advised prudence, as was
made manifest by what happened among us, of which I will now rehearse the
particulars, and the part I had in it myself. As soon as it was understood among the commonality that the French were
determined to subdue and make a conquest of Britain, as they had done of
all the rest of Europe, holding the noses of every continental king and
potentate to the grindstone, there was a prodigious stir and motion in
all the hearts and pulses of Scotland, and no where in a more vehement
degree than in Gudetown. But, for some reason or an other which I could
never dive into the bottom of, there was a slackness or backwardness on
the part of government in sending instructions to the magistrates to step
forward; in so much that the people grew terrified that they would be
conquered, without having even an opportunity to defend, as their fathers
did of old, the hallowed things of their native land; and, under the
sense of this alarm, they knotted themselves together, and actually drew
out proposals and resolutions of service of their own accord; by which
means they kept the power of choosing their officers in their own hands,
and so gave many of the big-wigs of the town a tacit intimation that they
were not likely to have the command. While things were in this process, the government had come to its senses;
and some steps and measures were taken to organize volunteer corps
throughout the nation. Taking heart from them, other corps were proposed
on the part of the gentry, in which they were themselves to have the
command; and seeing that the numbers were to be limited, they had a wish
and interest to keep back the real volunteer offers, and to get their own
accepted in their stead. A suspicion of this sort getting vent, an
outcry of discontent thereat arose against them; and to the consternation
of the magistrates, the young lads, who had at the first come so briskly
forward, called a meeting of their body, and, requesting the magistrates
to be present, demanded to know what steps had been taken with their
offer of service; and, if transmitted to government, what answer had been
received. This was a new era in public affairs; and no little amazement and anger
was expressed by some of the town-council, that any set of persons should
dare to question and interfere with the magistrates. But I saw it would
never do to take the bull by the horns in that manner at such a time; so
I commenced with Bailie Sprose, my lord being at the time provost, and
earnestly beseeched him to attend the meeting with me, and to give a mild
answer to any questions that might be put; and this was the more
necessary, as there was some good reason to believe, that, in point of
fact, the offer of service had been kept back. We accordingly went to the meeting, where Mr Sprose, at my suggestion,
stated, that we had received no answer; and that we could not explain how
the delay had arisen. This, however, did not pacify the volunteers; but
they appointed certain of their own number, a committee, to attend to the
business, and to communicate with the secretary of state direct;
intimating, that the members of the committee were those whom they
intended to elect for their officers. This was a decisive step, and took
the business entirely out of the hands of the magistrates; so, after the
meeting, both Mr Sprose and myself agreed, that no time should be lost in
communicating to the lord-lieutenant what had taken place. Our letter, and the volunteers' letter, went by the same post; and on
receiving ours, the lord-lieutenant had immediately some conference with
the secretary of state, who, falling into the views of his lordship, in
preferring the offers of the corps proposed by the gentry, sent the
volunteers word in reply, that their services, on the terms they had
proposed, which were of the least possible expense to government, could
not be accepted. It was hoped that this answer would have ended the matter; but there were
certain propugnacious spirits in the volunteers' committee; and they
urged and persuaded the others to come into resolutions, to the effect
that, having made early offers of service, on terms less objectionable in
every point than those of many offers subsequently made and accepted,
unless their offer was accepted, they would consider themselves as having
the authority of his majesty's government to believe and to represent,
that there was, in truth, no reason to apprehend that the enemy meditated
any invasion and these resolutions they sent off to London forthwith,
before the magistrates had time to hear or to remonstrate against the use
of such novel language from our burgh to his majesty's ministers. We, however, heard something; and I wrote my lord, to inform him that the
volunteers had renewed their offer, (for so we understood their
representation was;) and he, from what he had heard before from the
secretary of state, not expecting the effect it would have, answered me,
that their offer could not be accepted. But to our astonishment, by the
same post, the volunteers found themselves accepted, and the gentlemen
they recommended for their officers gazetted; the which, as I tell
frankly, was an admonition to me, that the peremptory will of authority
was no longer sufficient for the rule of mankind; and, therefore, I
squared my after conduct more by a deference to public opinion, than by
any laid down maxims and principles of my own; the consequence of which
was, that my influence still continued to grow and gather strength in the
community, and I was enabled to accomplish many things that my
predecessors would have thought it was almost beyond the compass of man
to undertake. In the course of these notandums, I have, here and there, touched on
divers matters that did not actually pertain to my own magisterial life,
further than as showing the temper and spirit in which different things
were brought to a bearing; and, in the same way, I will now again step
aside from the regular course of public affairs, to record an occurrence
which, at the time, excited no small wonderment and sympathy, and in
which it was confessed by many that I performed a very judicious part. The event here spoken of, was the quartering in the town, after the
removal of that well-behaved regiment, the Argyle fencibles, the main
part of another, the name and number of which I do not now recollect; but
it was an English corps, and, like the other troops of that nation, was
not then brought into the sobriety of discipline to which the whole
British army has since been reduced, by the paternal perseverance of his
Royal Highness the Duke of York; so that, after the douce and respectful
Highlanders, we sorely felt the consequences of the outstropolous and
galravitching Englishers, who thought it no disgrace to fill themselves
as fou as pipers, and fight in the streets, and march to the church on
the Lord's day with their band of music. However, after the first
Sunday, upon a remonstrance on the immorality of such irreligious
bravery, Colonel Cavendish, the commandant, silenced the musicians. Among the officers, there was one Captain Armour, an extraordinar well
demeaned, handsome man, who was very shy of accepting any civility from
the town gentry, and kept himself aloof from all our ploys and
entertainments, in such a manner, that the rest of the officers talked of
him, marvelling at the cause, for it was not his wont in other places. One Sabbath, during the remembering prayer, Mr Pittle put up a few words
for criminals under sentence of death, there being two at the time in the
Ayr jail, at the which petition I happened to look at Captain Armour,
who, with the lave of the officers, were within the magistrates' loft,
and I thought he had, at the moment, a likeness to poor Jeanie Gaisling,
that was executed for the murder of her bastard bairn. This notion at the time disturbed me very much, and one thought after
another so came into my head, that I could pay no attention to Mr Pittle,
who certainly was but a cauldrife preacher, and never more so than on
that day. In short, I was haunted with the fancy, that Captain Armour
was no other than the misfortunate lassie's poor brother, who had in so
pathetical a manner attended her and the magistrates to the scaffold;
and, what was very strange, I was not the only one in the kirk who
thought the same thing; for the resemblance, while Mr Pittle was praying,
had been observed by many; and it was the subject of discourse in my shop
on the Monday following, when the whole history of that most sorrowful
concern was again brought to mind. But, without dwelling at large on the
particularities, I need only mention, that it began to be publicly
jealoused that he was indeed the identical lad, which moved every body;
for he was a very good and gallant officer, having risen by his own
merits, and was likewise much beloved in the regiment. Nevertheless,
though his sister's sin was no fault of his, and could not impair the
worth of his well-earned character, yet some of the thoughtless young
ensigns began to draw off from him, and he was visited, in a manner, with
the disgrace of an excommunication. Being, however, a sensible man, he bore it for a while patiently, may be
hoping that the suspicion would wear away; but my lord, with all his
retinue, coming from London to the castle for the summer, invited the
officers one day to dine with him and the countess, when the fact was
established by a very simple accident. Captain Armour, in going up the stairs, and along the crooked old
passages of the castle, happened to notice that the colonel, who was in
the van, turned to the wrong hand, and called to him to take the other
way, which circumstance convinced all present that he was domestically
familiar with the labyrinths of the building; and the consequence was,
that, during dinner, not one of the officers spoke to him, some from
embarrassment and others from pride. The earl perceiving their demeanour, enquired of the colonel, when they
had returned from the table to the drawing-room, as to the cause of such
a visible alienation, and Colonel Cavendish, who was much of the
gentleman, explaining it, expressing his grief that so unpleasant a
discovery had been made to the prejudice of so worthy a man, my lord was
observed to stand some time in a thoughtful posture, after which he went
and spoke in a whisper to the countess, who advised him, as her ladyship
in the sequel told me herself, to send for me, as a wary and prudent man. Accordingly a servant was secretly dispatched express to the town on that
errand; my lord and my lady insisting on the officers staying to spend
the evening with them, which was an unusual civility at the _pro forma_
dinners at the castle. When I arrived, the earl took me into his private library, and we had
some serious conversation about the captain's sister; and, when I had
related the circumstantialities of her end to him, he sent for the
captain, and with great tenderness, and a manner most kind and gracious,
told him what he had noticed in the conduct of the officers, offering his
mediation to appease any difference, if it was a thing that could be
done. While my lord was speaking, the captain preserved a steady and unmoved
countenance: no one could have imagined that he was listening to any
thing but some grave generality of discourse; but when the earl offered
to mediate, his breast swelled, and his face grew like his coat, and I
saw his eyes fill with water as he turned round, to hide the grief that
could not be stifled. The passion of shame, however, lasted but for a
moment. In less time than I am in writing these heads, he was again
himself, and with a modest fortitude that was exceedingly comely, he
acknowledged who he was, adding, that he feared his blameless disgrace
entailed effects which he could not hope to remove, and therefore it was
his intention to resign his commission. The earl, however, requested
that he would do nothing rashly, and that he should first allow him to
try what could be done to convince his brother officers that it was
unworthy of them to act towards him in the way they did. His lordship
then led us to the drawing-room, on entering which, he said aloud to the
countess in a manner that could not be misunderstood, "In Captain Armour
I have discovered an old acquaintance, who by his own merits, and under
circumstances that would have sunk any man less conscious of his own
purity and worth, has raised himself, from having once been my servant,
to a rank that makes me happy to receive him as my guest." I need not add, that this benevolence of his lordship was followed with a
most bountiful alteration towards the captain from all present, in so
much that, before the regiment was removed from the town, we had the
satisfaction of seeing him at divers of the town-ploys, where he received
every civility. At the conclusion of my second provostry, or rather, as I think, after it
was over, an accident happened in the town that might have led to no
little trouble and contention but for the way and manner that I managed
the same. My friend and neighbour, Mr Kilsyth, an ettling man, who had
been wonderful prosperous in the spirit line, having been taken on for a
bailie, by virtue of some able handling on the part of Deacon Kenitweel,
proposed and propounded, that there should be a ball and supper for the
trades; and to testify his sense of the honour that he owed to all the
crafts, especially the wrights, whereof Mr Kenitweel was then deacon, he
promised to send in both wine, rum, and brandy, from his cellar, for the
company. I did not much approve of the project, for divers reasons; the
principal of which was, because my daughters were grown into young
ladies, and I was, thank God, in a circumstance to entitle them to hold
their heads something above the trades. However, I could not positively
refuse my compliance, especially as Mrs Pawkie was requested by Bailie
Kilsyth, and those who took an active part in furtherance of the ploy, to
be the lady directress of the occasion. And, out of an honour and homage
to myself, I was likewise entreated to preside at the head of the table,
over the supper that was to ensue after the dancing. In its own nature, there was surely nothing of an objectionable
principle, in a "trades' ball;" but we had several young men of the
gentle sort about the town, blythe and rattling lads, who were welcome
both to high and low, and to whom the project seemed worthy of a
ridicule. It would, as I said at the time, have been just as well to
have made it really a trades' ball, without any adulteration of the
gentry; but the hempies alluded to jouked themselves in upon us, and
obligated the managers to invite them; and an ill return they made for
this discretion and civility, as I have to relate. On the nightset for the occasion, the company met in the assembly-room,
in the New-inns, where we had bespoke a light genteel supper, and had
M'Lachlan, the fiddler, over from Ayr, for the purpose. Nothing could be
better while the dancing lasted; the whole concern wore an appearance of
the greatest genteelity.
