But my

experience at the university had killed the purity and delicacy of my moral discrimination. In Wales the end I proposed to myself in my actions, was

my own approbation; at Oxford I had regulated my conduct by the sentiments of others, not those of my own heart. I had been a noisy and jovial companion; I had
associated freely and cordially with characters of either sex, that my judgment did not approve. Friendships like these had indeed been of short duration;
but
they were of sufficient power to contaminate the mind, and distort the rectitude of feeling and habit. From intimacies built on so slight and inadequate a
basis, from a practical disregard of continence and modesty, the transition was easy to the toleration and abetting of the most shameless adultery. At the university I had been driven from a sort of necessity to live upon the applauses of others; and, the habit being once formed, I carried it along with me
in my excursion to the continent. In the societies to which I was introduced, no man was considered as any thing, unless he were, what they styled, un homme � bonnes fortunes , that is, an
individual devoted to the formation of intrigues, and a favourite with those ladies of honourable seeming, who held their virtue at a cheap rate. The men who

were regarded in Paris as models of politeness, stimulated me to pursuits of this sort by the tenour of their conversation, while the women from time to
time,
who boasted of rank, beauty and elegant manners, invited me by their insinuations and carriage, and taught me to believe that I should not be unsuccessful in

my enterprises. I was young and unguarded; I had no Mentor to set my follies before me in their true light; I had passed the Rubicon of vice, and therefore
was
deficient in the salutary checks of reflection. My vanity was flattered by the

overtures of the fair; my ambition was awakened by the example of the prosperous and the gay; I soon made my choice, and determined that I also would be un
homme � bonnes fortunes. The first woman who in this career fixed my regard was a finished coquette, by which epithet I understand a woman whose ruling passion is her vanity, and whose
invention is hourly on the rack for means of gratifying it. She was a lady of high rank, and married to a person of great figure at court. I first obtained
her
attention under favour of the epithet, by which the Parisian belles thought proper to distinguish me, of the handsome Englishman. Sir Charles, my introducer,

was certainly of more established vogue than myself, and in this respect might have seemed a conquest still more flattering to a person of her character. But

the marchioness easily discerned that he would have afforded her less occupation

and amusement. Sir Charles would perhaps have equalled me in constancy and perseverance; but he had a calmness of temper in affairs of this sort, which to her
tastes would have been intolerable. Obedient, obsequious, patient of injuries, he would undoubtedly have shown himself; he was of a character unalterably
obliging toward the fair; to violence he would have opposed no violence in return, but would have waited till the storm was dissipated, and then have sought
to
improve the lucky moment, when the bird of peace brooded over the subsiding billows, and the tumult of the bosom was ended. My character was of an opposite sort. Sir Charles appeared to the animated and restless spirit of the marchioness more like a convenient instrument, or a
respectable piece of furniture, than a living being whose passions were to mix, and shock, and contend, and combine

with her own. She would have preferred a lap-dog who, when she pinched or slapped him, would ruffle his hairs, and snarl and bark in return, to such a lover. To vex the temper and alarm the fears of her admirer was her delight. She would not have thought him worth her care, if she did not ten times in the day make

him curse himself, his mistress and all the world. She desired no sympathy and love, that were not ushered in by a prelude of something like hate. In a word,

she aspired to the character ascribed by Martial to one of his friends: "There was no living with him, nor without him." The singularities of this woman's temper particularly displayed themselves, in the gradations she introduced into the favours by which my attachment was
ultimately crowned. I might describe the transport of my soul, when I first became assured that there was no mark of

her good will which she was inclined to withhold from me. I might delineate the ravishing sweetness of the weather on the day which first gave me possession of
her person, the delightful excursion we made on the water, the elegantly furnished cottage that received us, the very room, with all its furniture, which
witnessed the consummation of my joys. All these things live in my memory, and constitute a picture, which will never be obliterated while this heart
continues
to beat. But I suppress these circumstances, at the risk of rendering my narrative flat and repulsive by its generalities. I write no book, that shall tend
to
nourish the pruriency of the debauched, or that shall excite one painful emotion, one instant of debate, in the bosom of the virtuous and the chaste. The marchioness tormented me with her flights and uncertainty, both before and after the completing my wishes. In

the first of these periods I thought myself ten times at the summit of my desires, when again I was, in the most unexpected manner, baffled and thrown back by
her caprices and frolics. Even after, as I have said, the first ceremonies were adjusted, and the treaty of offence was not only signed, but sealed,
Me of my yielded pleasure she beguil'd,
And taught me oft forbearance;
though I cannot say, in the sense in which Shakespear has imputed it to his heroine, that she did it, with
A pudency so rosy, the sweet look on't
Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her
As chaste as unsunn'd snow. It was in my nature to attach myself strongly, where I attached myself at all, and by parity of reason to be anxious

concerning propriety of conduct, and the minutenesses of behaviour, in the person I loved. This was exceedingly unfortunate for me in my affair with the
marchioness. It was almost impossible to make her serious. At moments when all other human beings are grave, and even in allowing those freedoms which ought
to
be pledges of the soul, she could not put off an air of badinage and raillery. Her mind greatly resembled in its constitution the sleek and slippery form of

the eel; it was never at rest, and, when I thought I possessed it most securely, it escaped me with the rapidity of lightning. No strength could detain it;
no
stratagem could hold it; no sobriety and seriousness of expostulation could fix it to any consistency of system. Had this been the only characteristic of her mind, a person of my temper would soon have been worn out with the

inexhaustibleness of her freaks and follies. But she had an ingenuousness of carriage by which I was for a long time deceived. She seemed, when I could gain
her ear for a moment, to confess her faults and absurdities with a simplicity and unreserve that was inexpressibly charming: and she had in herself an
equability of soul that nothing could destroy. Where other women would have been exasperated, she laughed; and, when by her flightiness she had driven her
lover to the extremity of human bearing, she mollified him in a moment by a gentleness and defencelessness of concession that there was no resisting. Yet it

often happened, that she had no sooner by this expedient won my forgiveness, than she flew off again with her customary wildness, and urged me almost to
madness. One passion which eminently distinguished the marchioness, was the perpetual

desire of doing something that should excite notice and astonishment. If in the privacy of the t�te � t�te she was not seldom in a singular degree provoking,
in public and in society she was, if possible, still worse. The human being, who is perpetually stimulated with the wish to do what is extraordinary, will
almost infallibly be often led into what is absurd, indelicate and unbecoming. It is incredible what excesses of this sort the marchioness committed. Her
passion seemed particularly to prompt her to the bold, the intrepid and the masculine. An impudent and Amazonian stare, a smack of the whip, a slap on the
back, a loud and unexpected accost that made the hearer start again, were expedients frequently employed by her to excite the admiration of those with whom
she
associated. In the theatre she would talk louder than the performers; in a dance, by some ridiculous

caprice she would put out those with whom she was engaged; she was never satisfied unless the observation of all eyes were turned on her. It might seem at first sight that a demeanour of this sort would excite general disapprobation, and make every one her enemy. On the contrary the marchioness
was an universal favourite, at least with the male sex. Her countenance was exquisitely beautiful; in her eye was combined a feminine softness with vivacity

and fire; her figure, which a little exceeded the middle size, seemed moulded by the Graces, and every thing she did was done with an ease and elegance that

dazzled the beholders. What would have been absurd and indecorous in most women, became pleasing and ornamental in her. Though the substance of the action
was
wrong, the manner seemed to change its nature, and render it brilliant and beautiful. She did impudent things without assumption and arrogance; and what in another would have been beyond endurance, seemed in her an emanation of the purest
artlessness and innocence. Besides, that such was the rapidity and quickness of her nature, she did not allow to ordinary observers the time to disapprove. She
never dwelt upon any thing; nothing was done with slowness and deliberation; and she passed so incessantly from one object of attention and mode of action to

another, that every thing seemed obliterated as soon as seen, and nothing was left in the common mind but a general impression of wonder and delight. This however was not the effect upon me. I often took upon myself to censure the improprieties of the marchioness. My murmurs, as I have said, never put her
out of temper. Sometimes she would rally me upon my severity, and vow that, instead

of a young and agreeable lover, she had by some chance fallen upon a morose philosopher, who wanted nothing but a long gown and a beard, to make him the worthy
successor of Diogenes. Sometimes she would play off her usual arts, and, by some agreeable tale, or amusing sally of wit, force my attention to another
subject. At other times she would put the woman upon me, display her charms, assume the attitudes, the gestures, and expression of features, allied to
voluptuousness, and make it impossible for a young and susceptible admirer as I was, to give breath to another word of harsh and ungentle signification. On a

few occasions, she would personate a seriousness, responsive to my seriousness, promise to be very good, and to conduct herself hereafter in a manner that
should command my approbation. Her most ordinary method however was to ridicule my advices, and exasperate

me by pertinacious and incorrigible folly; and it was never till she had exercised my patience to the utmost, that she condescended to soothe me with
blandishments and promises of amendment. Inconsistency was the very element in which she moved; and accordingly, whatever was the penitence she displayed, and the amendment she promised, this one
feature constantly attended her, that these little expiations never produced any effect on her conduct, and that the fault she professed most solemnly to
abjure, was sure to be the fault she would be the earliest to commit. The torment which this species of character in a mistress inflicted on me is undescribable. The pain I suffered from the excesses she fell into was vehement:
when she frankly confessed how much she had been to blame, I became almost angry with myself for the gravity of my

censure: and when again I saw her repeat the same unbecoming folly without reflection or hesitation, I was confounded at so unexpected an event, and cursed my
own infatuation; at the same time that, in spite of myself, I could not help admiring the artless and simple grace, which even upon such occasions did not
desert her. One thing that contributed, perhaps more than all the rest, to make this woman of so much importance to me, was the perpetual occupation she
afforded to my thoughts. Abroad or at home, in company or alone, she for ever engaged my attention, and kept my soul in a tumult, sometimes, though rarely,
of
pleasure, frequently of apprehension, alarm, jealousy, displeasure and condemnation. One question continually haunted my thoughts. This woman, so frivolous, so fickle, so uncertain, could she love? If not, was it not beneath the character of

a man, to be so perpetually occupied about a person, whom I felt to be of so little genuine worth, and by whom I was continually deluded? These doubts, this
self-questioning and compunction incessantly haunted me. Yet, in the midst of all my struggles, one inviting wave of her hand, one encouraging glance of her

eye, brought me in a moment to her feet. Never satisfied in this point, I however gratuitously ascribed to her a thousand virtues. Grace has something in it so nearly akin to moral rectitude and
truth, that the unvitiated observer can scarcely disjoin them even in imagination, or persuade himself to believe that, where the former is, the latter is
not. True, unaffected grace seems the very reflection of a candour and sincerity, which, knowing no wrong, has nothing to disguise. It is free from perplexity and

effort; the heart appears to be on the

lips, the soul to beam from the countenance. Was not so perfect an ingenuousness sufficient to atone for innumerable errors? I know not whether the rest of my
species are framed to receive so pure a delight as I originally did from the very sight of a serene and composed human countenance. A thousand times, when my

heart has burned with anger, the smile of him who had offended me, even though a common acquaintance, has disarmed me. I have said, "That calm expression,
that
unwrinkled physiognomy, that quiet, unruffled eye, can never be the cloke of a mind which deserves my hate; I feel in it, as it were, the precept of God
speaking to my eye, and commanding me to cherish, assist and love my fellow-man." When absent from him who had awakened my resentment, I could feel aversion,

and recollect many severe and bitter remarks with which I was desirous to taunt him;

when present, his voice, his countenance changed the whole tenour of my thoughts, and tamed me in a moment. If this were the case in reference to one of my own
sex, and an ordinary acquaintance, it may easily be supposed how I felt toward a mistress, who had excited in me, under some of its forms, the passion of
love. Our correspondence for some weeks was such, as, while it furnished an almost incessant occupation for my own thoughts, left me, I believed, little reason to
apprehend that the marchioness was less engrossed by me. But I was mistaken. I was at present wholly new to the world of gallantry. I had led a life of
dissipation at Oxford. But, hardened and brutalised, as to a certain degree I was, by the associates of my excesses, and having never encountered in these
pursuits a woman of distinction, of interesting story, or engaging manners,

I had scarcely ever felt a single flutter of the heart in these idle and degrading engagements. It was far different now. My vanity was stimulated by a success
so flattering as that of my amour with the marchioness appeared in my eye. Often I trod in air; often I felt the quick pants of my bosom, and walked with
head
erect, as if respiring a sublimer element, even when in solitude I reflected on the homage which this proud beauty paid to the attractions of my person, and

the persuasion of my tongue. Of all the trophies which vain mortals boast,
By wit, by valour, or by wisdom won,
The first and fairest in a young man's eye,
Is woman's captive heart. I was therefore in the wrong to measure the modes of thinking or of sensation in my mistress's bosom by my own. She had long been inured to those things

which were new and interesting to me, and she felt them not less coldly than she expressed them. I was willing to impute a contrast between her language and
her sentiments; but in this respect I did the marchioness wrong; she was no hypocrite here. At length sir Charles Gleed removed the film which had grown over my eyes, and cured me of my infatuation. Sir Charles was a man who in many points,
observations of detail, saw the world more truly than I did. I have often remarked, though I will not affirm how far it is to be taken as a general rule,
this
difference between men of imagination, and those whom I will call men of simple perception. It is something like a poet and a cultivator of the soil,
ascending
one of the Welsh mountains, or tracing together the tracts of land, meadow by meadow, which might be discovered from the top of it. The farmer

sees the nature of the fields, the character of their soil, and what species of vegetation is most adapted to grow in them. If he looks upward, he can tell the
configuration of the clouds, the quarter from which the wind blows, and the prognostications of the weather. When he comes home, he can count up the plots of

ground over which he has passed, the regions to the right and left, and enumerate the wheat, the barley, the oats, the rye, the clover and the grass, which
grew in each. The poet, during the progress we are supposing, saw much less, though his mind was more active and at work than that of the farmer. The
farmer's
were perceptions; his were feelings. He saw things in masses, not in detail. He annexed a little romance to each. In the clouds he discerned a passage,
through
which he passed, and beyond which he plunged in imagination into the world unknown. It was not green and blue, ripe and immature, fertile and barren, that he saw; it was beauty and harmony and life, accompanied with a silent eloquence which
spoke to his soul. The universe was to him a living scene, animated by a mysterious power, whose operations he contemplated with admiration and reverence. To

express the difference in one word; what the farmer saw was external and in the things themselves; what the poet saw was the growth and painting of his own
mind. The difference between sir Charles Gleed and myself was parallel to this, when we mingled in the scenes of human society. While he saw only those things in
character and action which formed the substance of what was seen by every beholder, he was led astray by no prepossessions or partialities, and drew a great

number of just conclusions from the indications before him. I on

the contrary entered into every scene with certain expectations, and with a little system of my own forming ready digested in my mind. If I repaired to Notre
Dame at Paris to assist at the celebration of the high mass solemnised on the eve of the Nativity, my thoughts were full of the wonderful efficacy which
religion exercises over my species, and my memory stored with the sublime emotions which altars and crucifixes and tapers had excited in the souls of saints

and martyrs. If I entered the walls of the British house of commons, and waited to hear an important debate, the scenes of past ages revolved before the eyes

of my fancy, and that parliament again filled the benches in which Pym and Hambden, and Falkland and Selden, and Cromwel and Vane sat together, to decide,
perhaps for ever, on the civil and intellectual liberties of my country. These are only instances. But in reality

scarcely any character of the smallest importance came before me, in whom, by retrospect or anticipation, by associations of pride, of instruction, or of
honour, I did not make to myself a lively interest, and whom I did not involuntarily surround with an atmosphere of my own creating, which refracted the rays

of light, and changed the appearances of the scene. These causes rendered me a less dispassionate, and therefore in many instances a less exact, though a
much
more earnest, observer than sir Charles Gleed. When sir Charles told me what he had remarked, I was struck with inexpressible astonishment. I could not at first believe the report he made, and reproached
him in my thoughts for that vulgarity of mind, which made him always see in the actions of others something allied to his own. I asked him a thousand
questions; I demanded from

him a thousand proofs; and it was not till he had given me evidences amounting to demonstration, that I consented to part with a delusion which had been so
delightful to my mind. That the marchioness, whom I had so entirely loved, in whose partiality I had so much prided myself, whose smallest errors had
afflicted
me as spots upon the lustre of her qualities, should be a woman of abandoned character, disengaged from all restraints of decency and shame, that, when I
thought I possessed her whole, I really divided her favours with every comer,---a music-master---an artisan---a valet,---it is impossible to express how
sudden
and terrible a revolution this discovery produced within me! I was in Paris, and I did as people of fashion in Paris were accustomed to do. I consoled myself for the infidelity of one mistress, by devoting my attentions
to another. The qualities of the countess de B. were exceedingly unlike those of the marchioness; perhaps, led by a sentiment to which I was unconscious, I
selected her for that very reason. The marchioness I have compared to the sleek and glossy-coated eel: for ever restless, never contented with the thing, or

the circumstances under which she was, you could never hold her to one certain mode of proceeding. The only way in which for her lover to become satisfied
with
her, was to persuade himself that her external demeanour was merely

a guise put on, which belied her heart, and that, when she seemed most impatient, capricious and fantastical, her soul confessed none of these follies, but
assumed them to veil the too great sensibility of her nature. The countess on the contrary appeared to be wholly destitute of art. Though passed the first
season of youthful inexperience, she appeared to have acquired none of the lessons of prudery and factitious decorum. Her heart shone in her visage; the very

tones of her voice were modulated to the expression of tenderness. Hers was "the sleepy eye, that spoke the melting soul." Her cheek was full; her skin
transparent; the least thought of pleasure or of passion suffused her countenance with a blush. The countess had no atom of the restlessness of her rival; a

sort of voluptuous indolence continually attended her; and the busy nothings of ordinary life seemed to

be an insupportable burthen to her. She appeared born only to feel; to reflect, to consider, to anticipate, to receive and concoct the elements of instruction,
were offices in which she seemed incapable to exist. It was her habit therefore to resign herself wholly to her feelings, and to be in them undivided and
entire. To judge from every exterior indication, it was impossible for a tenderer mistress to exist; she gave herself up to her lover, and treated him as if
he
were father, mother, fortune, reputation and life to her, in one. She placed no restraint on herself, but appeared all anxiety, terror, apprehension,
gratitude, enjoyment, as the occasions most obviously led to one or another of these emotions. Yet this woman was capable of the more stormy impulses of resentment and jealousy, but only in such a way as best accorded with the sensibility and
voluptuousness

of her character. Her resentment was passive and desponding; when wounded, it appeared incompatible with the purpose of wounding again; in the person against
whom it was directed it excited not sentiments of hostility, but of pity; and her tender bosom seemed to wait only the moment of passionate reconciliation. When her lover returned to her, or persuaded her of the sincerity of his affection, gratitude and delight possessed her wholly, and reproach died away upon
her
lips. The countess by her manners reminded her admirer, of the most delicate flower of the parterre, which the first attack of a rude and chilling blast
immediately withers, but which, by the lustre of its tints, and the softness of its texture, seems to advance an irresistible claim to gentle protection and

western breezes. Tears from her sparkling eyes broke forth almost at will; by a tear she expressed

her sufferings, and by a tear her joy. This might perhaps have been grievous to her lover, had she had the smallest bias towards a querulous temper. But her
character was a perpetual summer; her storms were only like the soft droppings of a sultry evening, and easily gave place to a fair sky and a radiant
heaven. The intellect of the countess de B. was of narrow dimensions. Her mind had never been turmoiled with the infusions of science; she scarcely knew that there
were antipodes, or that there had been ancients. She lived like those insects which the naturalists describe, generated on the surface of certain lakes, that

are born only to hover along the superficies of the pellucid element, to enjoy, and to die. What pity that the sentiments of such a person as the countess de B. were so little entitled to be depended upon! According

to the ideas many men entertain of the fair sex, it was impossible for any one in the particulars above described to be more exactly qualified for a mistress
or a wife than this fascinating woman. There was no danger that she should become the rival of her lover in any manlike pursuits, or that with troublesome
curiosity she should intrude herself into his occupations of learning, of gain, or of ambition. She had all the attributes that belong exclusively to the
female sex, and as few as possible of those which are possessed by the whole species, male and female, in common. She was rather an Asiatic sultana in her
turn
of mind, than a native of our western world. And her habits would have been equally accommodated to the man who, having serious pursuits for his graver
hours,
wished either not to impart, or not to remember them in his hours of pleasure; and to the man who, being in the hey-day

of his youth, and favoured by nature and by fortune, desired to thrust the world aside, and take his swing of indulgence uninterrupted and unchecked. I
belonged to this latter description. Unfortunately however the countess, though she seemed to feel with her soul, had the spring of her sentiments and actions in her eyes. Where she attached
herself, it was with such a show of ardour, that the lover must have been captious and difficult indeed, who was not satisfied with the sincerity of passion

she displayed toward him. Yet the passion of the countess was rather an abstract propensity, than the preference of an individual. A given quantity of
personal
merit and accomplished manners was sure to charm her. A fresh and agreeable complexion, a sparkling eye, a well-turned leg, a grace in dancing or in
performing
the manoeuvres of gallantry, were claims that

the countess de B. was never known to resist. She appeared to administer her decisions upon these different pretensions with the most rigid equity; and they
were sometimes very minute distinctions, scarcely discernible by the naked eye, that decided her hair-breadth preferences. Upon this rigid equity there was
only one limitation; and this also was sufficiently in correspondence with the theory of the subject. Among the various sources of what are called the
pleasures of the imagination, one, as learned doctors tell us, is novelty. To this the countess de B. paid the strictest attention; and, where there was any

uncertainty in the comparison of personal advantages or polite accomplishments, the latest pretender was sure to carry the day. Amiable countess! Like the
wanton bee, which flits from flower to flower, equally enamoured with each in turn, and retaining no painful recollections

of that which was last quitted, to render the qualities of the next offerer less agreeable and exquisite. I remember her even at this time with kindness. She
seemed to skim the surface of life, and to taste of a continual succession of pleasures. It was perhaps unreasonable ever to be angry with her. She had
almost
too little reflection and concatenation of ideas, to make her a competent subject of moral jurisdiction. It was not however always thus with her; her career

was short, and she expiated by long and severe calamities for her brief period of unchecked enjoyment. Whatever may be thought of her demerits, few persons
ever drank more deeply of the cup of retribution. But this does not belong to my history. It will easily be concluded from what I have stated, that the termination of my amour with the countess de B. was very similar to that with the marchioness. I

trusted; I was deceived; my eyes were opened; I suffered all the torments of disappointment and despair. A quick and living sensitiveness was one of the most
obvious characteristics of my mind; and few men felt disappointment of almost every kind more deeply. When the breach took place between me and the
marchioness, I had been for some days like a man distracted. The countess de B. presented herself to my observation just at that critical moment; the more
than
feminine gentleness and softness of her nature were exactly adapted to allure my attention in this period of anguish; and it was owing to this fortuitous
concurrence, that I recovered my equilibrium, in a certain degree, much sooner than could reasonably have been expected. It has often been a matter of jest
in
the world, when a widower, who seemed to be inconsolable for the partner of his heart, suddenly marries again;

and the inference usually drawn is, that his grief was pure mummery and representation. I grant that the man who thus conducts himself is guilty of a breach of
decorum, and that his behaviour is rather calculated to excite our disesteem than our respect; but I affirm that it is sufficiently natural, and that there
is
no need of having recourse to the imputation of hypocrisy to account for it. There is a principle in man, impelling him to seek his own preservation, and
pursue his own happiness; and this principle will frequently urge him, in proportion to the dreadful vacuity produced by the loss of that which no
possibility
can restore to him, to seek to replace it by somewhat of the same species, and to endeavour to relieve his disconsolate state by a companion, who may in like

manner share his thoughts, and engage his tenderness. The loss of the countess was much

more terrible to me than that of her predecessor. The marchioness had kept me in a state of perpetual agitation, a temper of mind not unallied to fortitude. The countess de B. had softened and relaxed my mind, and left in me a temper ill-suited to the struggling with misfortune. The marchioness was a woman that I

loved and hated by turns; she was often too masculine and peremptory to be an object of tenderness; her character, adapted continually to produce wonder and

astonishment, lost by just so much of the faculty to please. But the countess was all sweetness. In the eyes of her lover she appeared like an angel. She
rose
upon him like the evening star, mild, radiant, tranquil and soothing. In periods of the most entire communication and accord, she seemed to leave him nothing

to wish, but appeared in his eyes the exact model of perfection. From the marchioness you continually expected

something extraordinary; her ambition was to shine; and that which is extraordinary, must of course be sometimes good, and sometimes ill. But the countess de
B. was so simple, so intelligible; it seemed as if nothing could happen with her that might not exactly be foreseen; she was wholly engaged in the object of

her selection, and appeared to live for that alone. The distress I suffered from the inconstancy of the countess de B. was inexpressibly acute. It taught me to abhor and revile her sex. It inspired me with a
contempt of human pleasures. I felt like the personage of a fairy-tale I have somewhere read, who, after being delighted with the magnificence of a seeming
palace, and the beauty of its fair inhabitants, suddenly sees the delusion vanish, the palace is converted into a charnel-house, and what he thought its
beautiful tenants are seen to be the most

withered and loathsome hags that ever shocked the eyes of a mortal. My soul was in tumults. I loathed existence and the sight of day; and my self-love was
inexpressibly shocked to think that I could have suffered so gross a delusion. I fled from Paris, and sought the craggy and inhospitable Alps; the most
frightful scenes alone had power to please, and produced in me a kind of malicious and desperate sentiment of satisfaction. Most earnestly do I intreat the reader to pardon me, for having thus much interspersed these pages with a tale of debaucheries. It is not, I solemnly assure
him, that I have any pleasure in the recollection, or that I glory in my shame. Some men, I know, would palliate this narrative to themselves, by saying that

the things here related belong to the country where my scene is placed, and that morals have no certain standard, but change their laws according to the

climate in which they exist. From my soul do I abjure this apology. Without entering abstrusely into the general merits of the question, I intimately feel in
myself, that I carry about me, wherever I go, the same criterion of approbation, which bends to no customs, and asks no support from the suffrage of others
to
make it what it is. At the time of which I have been speaking, I was young and wild; I had been much injured by the sort of company I frequented for some
years
before I left England; and I gave easily and without compunction into the dissipations of the metropolis of France. But I do not look back upon them without

aversion. I have written the narrative of this period under impressions of deep pain, and every line has cost me a twinge of the sharpest remorse. There are

some kinds of writing in which the mind willingly engages, in which, while we hold the pen in our

hand, we seem to unburthen the sentiments of our soul, and our habitual feelings cause us to pour out on the paper a prompt and unstudied eloquence. Here on
the contrary, I have held myself to my task with difficulty, and often with my utmost effort I have scarcely wrote down a page a day on the ungrateful
subject. Why have I introduced it then? Because it was necessary, to make my subsequent history understood. I have a train of follies, less loathsome, but more tragic,
to unfold, which could not have been accounted for, unless it had been previously shown, by what causes I, the author, and in some respects the principal
sufferer, was rendered what I was. I was a misanthrope. Not a misanthrope of the sterner and more rugged class, who, while they condemn and despise every
thing
around them, have a perverted sort of pleasure in the office,

whose brow for ever frowns, whose voice has the true cynical snarl, and who never feel so triumphant a complacency, as when they detect the worthlessness and
baseness of whoever comes into contact with them. This sort of man, even in my unhappiest state of desolation, I could always look down upon with pity. My
misanthropy was a conclusion, however erroneous, that I unwillingly entertained. I felt what I was, and I pined for the society of my like. It was with
inexpressible sorrow that I believed I was alone in the world. My sensibility was not one atom diminished by my perpetual disappointments. I felt what man
ought to be, and I could not prevent the model of what he ought to be from being for ever present to my mind. I hastened , as I have already said, from Paris, and plunged amidst the wild and desolate scenery of mount Jura. The next intended stage of my travels was
Switzerland, and I pursued the road which led to that country. The first anxiety I felt was to escape from France. That kingdom had been the theatre of my
sufferings and my disgrace. There first I had felt my mind agitated with those emotions which are destined to have so mighty an influence on the fate of man. But how agitated? I had loved. I had not loved innocence; I had not loved the chaste simplicity of the female character: my affections had not gone forth
toward any object, which might refine and elevate my soul, which might

free me from the impurities I had contracted among the debauchces of the university, restore me to peace with myself, and prepare me to act an honourable part
on the theatre of society. Unfortunately my initiation had been in the polluted tracts of adulterous commerce. My mind had been acted upon with vehemence,
but
not improved. What true sympathy and affection can arise between persons of opposite sexes, when the basis upon which their intimacy is founded, is crime? when
all decorum and character are trampled under foot, and nothing is aimed at but licentious pleasure, at the expence of all our best duties, and all that is
truly honourable in human life? I had been interested in the marchioness. She had originally been considered by me as the model of a spirited, frank and ingenuous character. But the
affections of my soul had been much

more strongly excited by the countess de B. The marchioness was, and had ultimately been set down by me for, a character merely artificial. But the countess
was a woman who appeared to set up no defences, and employ no stratagems; who surrendered herself fully, with all her faculties and all her soul, to her
lover. In her I persuaded myself that I had found that true simplicity which is most worthy to engage the heart of every beholder. I did not perceive that she was
in
the worst sense of the word a sensualist, and that this was in a consummate degree a departure from the genuine female character; but unfortunately was
induced
to judge of the whole sex from the specimens which had thus been brought before me. Amidst the mountains which separate Switzerland from France, the idea of the countess was perpetually present to my thoughts. In Troyes and the other towns
which lay in my route, along the

populous roads, and by the side of navigable rivers, my thoughts were interrupted, if not amused: but the instant I plunged into solitude and the retreats of
uncultivated nature, my reveries became endless and inexhaustible. When I turned round a point of the rock, when I gazed intently, yet with an absent mind,
upon the deep shadows of the mountains, visto beyond visto, enveloped in clouds, lost in obscurity, and where no human form was to be discerned, there the
figure of the countess de B. flitted before me. I heard her voice between the pauses of the echoes, and amidst the dashing of the cascades. Why had I left her?---Had I left her? ---Why had she proved herself dishonourable and unworthy?---Was she indeed unworthy?---I believed every thing, and I
believed nothing. Ten times I was inclined again to turn my face toward Paris, and throw myself at her feet. She could not be guilty: that face was a

pledge of her rectitude: depravity and inconstancy could not lurk behind the lovely expression of that angelic countenance!---What, turn back, and expose
myself to the contempt of every one in Paris, and to her own? What, sue to her, that she would forgive to me the vices she had committed? Be a sharer of her

caresses with---? There was no such woman! It was all a delusion! I might look for her through Paris, and through the world, but should never find her. The
scales had dropped from my eyes, and I might pray in vain, if I could be worthless enough to pray, for the restoration of my former blindness. I descended the Alps, and entered into Switzerland. It may be, the very air of this country, the country of freedom, of independence, moderation and good
sense, had a favourable effect on my temper. I began now to think of M. Ruffigny, to whose protection and counsels my father had so emphatically recommended

commended me. Never did I hear the eulogium of one man pronounced by another with that energy and enthusiasm with which my father spoke of this venerable
Swiss. He had told me once and again at our parting, and in the letters he addressed to me in my travels, that, if ever I became the ornament of my house,
and
the benefactor of my fellows, it was to the friendship, the instructions and example of Ruffigny that he looked for that benefit. I had seen this friend of
my
father once only, when I was five years of age; and the vague and imperfect recollection which remained in my mind, gave a sort of sacredness to his figure,

and made him appear in my thoughts like a visitant from the starry spheres. As I approached nearer to the residence of this man, I began to examine whether I was prepared to appear in his presence. I painted to myself his habitation as
the grotto of an a�rial spirit, whither I was repairing to

do homage, and to receive the communications of an all-penetrating wisdom. While I had been engaged at Paris in the giddy round of licentious pursuits, I had
forgotten this incomparable friend; nothing that related to him sobered and awed me; but, now that I had set my foot upon his native soil, I already seemed
to
feel the contact of his mind and the emanations of his virtues. M. Ruffigny lived in a neat house which he had built for himself in the valley of Urseren; near the foot of mount St. Gothard, the tallest and most stupendous
of the hills of his country. It was a fine summer evening when I approached his residence. The beams of the setting sun illuminated the peaks of the
mountain,
and gave a divine tranquillity to the plains. I felt my heart relieved from the rude tempests and the flagging and noisome atmosphere which had oppressed it. The sun was declining,

and the heat of the day was over, when I entered a wood of tall and venerable trees, through which the road lay that led to his habitation. Nothing could be
more grateful than the fresh, cool air, which penetrated this wood. After having for some time pursued a serpentine path, I came within sight of the house,
and
perceived the old man in his garden, examining the processes of vegetation, and stretching forth his hand to relieve and to raise such of its productions as

stood in need of his aid. I had no doubt it was M. Ruffigny. I leaped from my horse, and, delivering him to the care of my servant, hastened to join the
friend
of my father. A little wicket at one extremity of the front of the house admitted me into the potagerie. The owner was tall, and of a venerable presence,
with
a little stoop in his carriage, his visage placid and his eye penetrating amidst the wrinkles of age,

and his hair as white as snow. He was somewhat turned from me as I approached, but, hearing a quick step, he lifted up his head, and surveyed me. I was too much engaged in contemplating his interesting figure, instantly to announce myself. He hesitated for a moment, and then spoke. Casimir Fleetwood! said he. The same.---He pressed my hand with peculiar emotion. The very image of Ambrose Fleetwood, his grandfather! I have expected your visit some time. I have a thousand things to say to you, and a thousand enquiries to
make. You look like an honest man, and an observing one. It does my old heart good, to receive under my roof the last representative of the friends I have
loved and honoured more than any others I ever had. M. Ruffigny proceeded to question me respecting my travels. How long I

had left England? Where I had been? What stay I had made in Paris? What society I had frequented? What connections I had formed? What remarks and conclusions I
had drawn from what I saw? He addressed to me no interrogatories but such as a friendly anxiety for my welfare might naturally dictate; yet I could perceive

that he endeavoured to draw from his enquiries materials for estimating my understanding and character. I acquitted myself in this experiment as I could,
though I felt embarrassed with the recollection of affairs and transactions in Paris, which I was not at present disposed to confide to M. Ruffigny. My
venerable host listened with attention to what I said, and sometimes interposed his commendation where he judged it deserved, but at no time did there drop
from his lips a syllable of censure. He probably conceived that premature criticisms on what I thought proper

to unfold, would check the spirit of communication, and lessen the opportunity to discover my character which he was desirous to obtain. As we walked up and down in the garden, engaged in this sort of conversation, I turned my eye occasionally round, and examined the spot in which I was placed. It was a scene in which use seemed to take the precedence of ornament. Though roses, woodbines, lilacs and laburnums, with such other flowering shrubs as
require little aid from the hand of the cultivator were interspersed, the plots into which the inclosure was divided were principally appropriated to pulse
and
other esculent vegetables, and were bordered with fruit-bearing plants and shrubs. On the lower side of the garden was seen the broad expanse of the Reuss,
which, though a little further from its source it dashes over rude fragments of rock in a continual cataract,

flows along the valley in a smooth and silent stream. The opposite side of the garden was skirted by the acclivity of the mountain, the surface of which to a
considerable height was covered with the most luxuriant vines my eyes ever beheld. After having walked for a considerable time, we went toward the house. Upon a smooth turf before the door was spread a table, with a few melons, grapes and
wall-fruit, a loaf of bread, and a flagon of weak, but agreeably flavoured, wine. This is my supper, said M. Ruffigny. We sat down together. We talked of
England, of France, and of the country in which we then were, and I was charmed and instructed with the acute remarks delivered by my host upon the
comparative
manners of each. He spoke with enthusiasm of the scenery of his native country, of the enviable freedom enjoyed by its inhabitants, and the happy equality
and
competence in which they

lived. Here, said he, you behold in happy contrast the simplicity of man, and the exuberance of nature. My countrymen appear in the plainness of what in
England you would call a quaker-like habit and manners, while the region that sustains them is clothed in all the dyes of heaven, and wantons herself in more

various forms of majesty and beauty than mere imagination could ever conceive. Hence I learn to venerate and respect the intelligible rectitude of the
species
to which I belong, and to adore with sacred awe the mysterious power, which draws us into existence, and nurses our inexperience in its genial bosom. The adventures through which I had passed, and the misanthropy I had contracted, did not allow me perfectly to accord with this sentiment of M. Ruffigny. The next morning my beneficent

friend received me in his library. It was the only spacious apartment in his house, and was fitted up with peculiar neatness and convenience. I cast my eyes
around upon the shelves, and perceived that they were principally furnished with the old poetical compositions of France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland,
together with a very complete collection of botanical writers, particularly those which treated of the natural productions of Helvetia. One compartment of
the
library was devoted to English authors, principally from the age of Elizabeth to the Restoration. I pass some hours of every day, said the old man, in this apartment; but my life is principally in the open air; I think more than I read; and I am more
attached to the great and living volume of nature, than to the cold, insensible, mechanically constructed pages and sheets that have been produced by my
fellow-creatures. Let no man despise the oracles of books! A book is a dead man, a sort of mummy, embowelled and embalmed, but that once had flesh, and motion, and a boundless
variety of determinations and actions. I am glad that I can, even upon these terms, converse with the dead, with the wise and the good of revolving
centuries. Without books I should not understand the volume of nature; I should pass the scanty years of my existence a mere novice; the life of a single man is too
short
to enable him to penetrate beyond the surface of things. The furniture of these shelves constitutes an elaborate and invaluable commentary; but the objects
beyond those windows, and the circles and communities of my contemporaries, are the text to which that commentary relates. After breakfast M. Ruffigny and myself walked out, and ascended one

branch of the St. Gothard. I was surprised to observe with what agility and spirit the old man encountered this species of labour. It is all use, said he.
