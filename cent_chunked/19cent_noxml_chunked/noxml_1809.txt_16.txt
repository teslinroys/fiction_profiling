To win it,-and what then?-Could he marry a girl devoid of fortune, so closely allied to
the strange Miss Moreton!-So-would not the whole world laugh at him? And was not the
institution of marriage merely a piece of worldly policy, which would be "more honoured in the
breach than the observance?" Could he then injure Mary Cuthbert, by inducing her to forego
such illiberal and superstitious observances? Such was the sophistical reveries of this modern
philosopher, while he bent his way to Dr. Saville's. The good Doctor was just stepping out on his fourth visit to Miss Cuthbert.-In a few
words Walsingham unfolded his business. "Ah!" said the Doctor, shaking his head, "I fear this poor girl will soon be released from
all human ties.-Her guardian is there," looking upwards, "to Him she will soon go, and dwell
with Him for ever!" He took Walsingham's arm, and they walked towards the inn together.-"I declare I can
scarcely grieve as I should do for this young creature," said Dr. Saville; "for, seeing her extreme
youth and ingenuous loveliness, and the caprice, folly-I may almost say madness of her
protectress, it appears to me, that if she is taken, it will be from the evil to come; for, surely, she
must require a more than common share of prudence and resolution, who can accompany this
wild and fantastic Miss Moreton in all her extravagant flights, and escape uninjured!" "But, dear Doctor, may it not be yet possible to recover her?" said Walsingham, grasping
his arm.-"All that I can do I will," said Dr. Saville; "I am now going to have her removed to a
neat and tranquil lodging in the environs of the town; and I have engaged a steady and humane
nurse to attend her. The people at the inn were naturally enough alarmed at having her with
them; and the noise of such a house is quite inimical to my hopes of a recovery.-Come with me,
if you are not afraid of infection, and see her removed. I have had a sedan chair taken to the inn,
and believe the poor girl will be wholly imperceptible of any thing that is going on." "No, I am not at all afraid of infection," said Walsingham, "I received the last words of
my poor corporal; he died in a few minutes after I quitted his room." The nurse engaged by Dr. Saville had dressed Mary Cuthbert, and she lay extended on
the bed, bereft of sense, and apparently motionless.-Her rayless eyes were fixed on vacancy;
her cheeks were flushed by fever; her lips frequently severed; and she muttered from time to time
short sentences, in a monotonous and almost death-like tone. "No, no, Miss Moreton, do not take me there.-My papa sees you-he sees you from
Heaven.-Look! he will not love you, if you carry his child to the soldiers. Poor Mary! nobody
cares for her now; all the world will despise her; but she will go home soon; she will go home to
her father's house-there are many mansions there-her Saviour has told her so!-Fie, fie, Miss
Moreton, don't YOU believe in Him? What would poor Mary do, if she had not got this
comfort?" Then she stopped; -heart-piercing sighs issued from her bosom. "No, no, no, I never
will enter the hateful barracks again.-Pray, pray Miss Moreton return home; look, look, they are
coming; they will fetch us back-the soldiers will keep us there!" and, with a strong convulsive
motion, she turned and grasped her pillow with violence. The marks of strong sympathy were visible on the countenance of Dr. Saville, while
Walsingham turned to the window to conceal his emotion and his bitter feelings! Yes! extended on the bed, the victim of fever, and in a state of mental delirium, yet Mary
Cuthbert had spoken to the heart of Lesly Walsingham!-She had talked of that Heaven which
he had abjured; she had talked of the comforts of a Saviour, whom he had never known.-But
was there not something unintelligible, mysterious, in his feelings and his emotions? Did not his
heart smite him for remaining deaf to the calls of conscience, to the voice of Heaven itself,
speaking as it did now by one of its own angels! With the utmost care, Mary Cuthbert was at length placed in the chair which had been
provided for her; the nurse went before to the lodgings, and the two gentlemen walked at her
side. Although she continued in a state of insensibility, yet her weakened frame experienced
the effects of this exertion; and when the nurse had got her into bed, she almost immediately fell
into a sound sleep, which, when the attentive Saville was informed of, appeared to give him the
greatest satisfaction; and, clapping the shoulder of Walsingham in an extacy, he declared that he
augured every thing from this repose. Several days passed, during which the disorder of the youthful invalid scarcely appeared
to abate; her two friends were unremitting in their attention; and the skill and exertion of Saville
kept pace with the good wishes of Walsingham, who ransacked the neighbourhood for any thing
and every thing, which had a shadow of benefiting Mary Cuthbert. "Heaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid,
"Some banish'd lover, or some captive maid." POPE. MISS Moreton had retired only a few miles from --, left entirely to her own profound
reveries, without flatterers or admirers; when it occurred to her that it might look unfeeling to
enter the world, whilst her charge remained at the point of death; and this period was not
uninterestingly filled up, by writing to Montgomery, and in anxiously awaiting his answer.-The
Corinna's letter ran thus:-
"In what words shall I address the worthiest of his sex, on a subject so near to both our
hearts. I have seen, I have witnessed that fervent passion of your's, which breathed in every look
and action, whilst in the presence of the object of it. I saw also the struggles of your noble mind,
which refused to ratify the wishes of your heart, when deeming them inimical to the interests of
the object of your love. Such love must be rewarded. I have the power, Montgomery; I have also
the will. Fortune has not been unworthily placed in my hands; sufficient is it for me to say, that
your passion is approved by me! nay more, that it is returned; and in cementing and ratifying the
union of two affectionate hearts, I feel that I am rising to the very acmï¿½ of my existence! Write
me by the return of the post. My heart aches to see you; and I shall remain at the place from
whence I date this letter, till I hear when I may expect it. "CORINNA MORETON." Montgomery's sensations of regret on quitting the Attic Villa had accompanied him to Oxford;
and the image of the beautiful Mary Cuthbert, exposed to all the follies and insults of Miss
Moreton's companions, was ever rising to his imagination. His heart had taken a more than
common interest in her fate; and he was unusually curious in making inquiries of those of his
acquaintance, who lived in the neighbourhood of Coventry, for information and anecdotes of
Miss Moreton. The knowledge, thus acquired, was not calculated to set his heart at ease with
regard to the youthful orphan. All agreed in ridiculing Miss Moreton, and in contemning her
manners and her conduct. It happened one morning that Montgomery carelessly took up a news
paper, and read the following paragraph:-
"NOTORIETY. "The celebrated Corinna, mistress of a certain Villa, not an hundred miles from C--y,
has lately displayed great novelty of conduct. Attended by several of her train, and a nymph to
whom she is guardian, she proceeded to that city on the first day of the fair, in a sort of triumphal
car; and, crowned with bay, harangued the mobility in a manner which caused no little ferment in
the public mind. Lady Godiva was deserted for this priestess of the new school; and the business
ended with all that noise and tumult, which usually attends a popular commotion. The horses of
the carriage were taken out, and the heroine was drawn home, by an infatuated mob, who
returned at night to pillage the mansion of their new teacher. We have heard of several accidents
which occurred in this temple of disorder and wild liberty. Most of the females, resident under
the roof, experienced insults of the most degrading kind; and one or two enlightened Parisians
were forced to save their heads, by an instantaneous use of their heels. The fair lady of the
mansion seems perfectly pleased at becoming the object of general animadversion, and, like
another Helen, enjoys the confusion she has caused. "O Tempora! O Mores!" Such was the paragraph which Montgomery read with horror. "Good God! had Mary
Cuthbert, the gentle Mary Cuthbert, been in a scene like this? Had the modest, the lovely Mary,
been exposed to the rude insults of a brutish rabble?" He smote his forehead; he stamped his foot
in agony on the floor; he wished-yes, he wished her in Heaven, rather than at the Attic Villa. "The temple of disorder, say, rather the temple of immorality and licentiousness," cried he,
"would that it were razed from the ground!" Many hours elapsed ere Montgomery could recover, from the agitation which the perusal
of this paragraph had caused in his bosom; but at length he resumed his studies, and tried to
compose his mind; though this hardly acquired composure was completely overset, by a letter
which he received from home, acquainting him with the dangerous illness of his beloved father. The filial heart of Montgomery bled at this intelligence; his father, his beloved, his honoured
parent! could it be possible? and should he indeed lose him for ever? Must he be snatched from
the fond arms of his faithful wife? Must he be taken from his helpless children? Helpless indeed! for on him had been the sole dependance of his family." Montgomery lost not a moment in leaving Oxford. The letter of Miss Moreton followed
him home, and his answer to it will best describe the hurried state of his mind at this period. "DEAR MADAM. "Elmsly-Tuesday. "Your kind favour followed me to this place; and, grateful as I must ever be to you for its
contents, and an explanation of your generous intentions in my favour, yet I must at this moment
recoil even from a perspective of happiness! for, alas! I am surrounded by distress of the most
afflicting nature! The grave receives my beloved father into its peaceful bosom. It has been my
hard duty to see him close his eye, an eye which beamed with goodness and virtue on all around
him. You, my dear Madam, will picture the distress of every individual under this roof. The
gentle being who honours Montgomery by her good opinion, will afford him her sympathy on
this most trying and conflicting period of his life. When my mind is a little more at ease, I will
resume my pen to express all with which this heart is fraught, to the object of my fondest
affection and respect; the gratitude which he must ever feel towards you, my dear Madam, who
signs himself, Your obliged and devoted
FREDERIC MONTGOMERY." "Fallacious hope deludes her hapless train!" LANGHORNE. OVERWHELMED by distress, Montgomery had read the letter of Miss Moreton with trembling
agitation. The sorrow of his mother, the affliction of his sisters, had almost bereft him of his selfpossession,
and he had been fearfully conjuring up the thousand evils which would await them. His own prospects, if not blighted, were wholly obscured. Instead of pushing his way in
the bustling and crowded walks of life, in order to further his advancement; his narrow path now
lay before him. The small living which his father had held would remain in the family. He must
immediately take orders; and, residing with his mother and sisters, try to contract his wishes, and
to repress his hopes; and be to them the husband, the father they had lost. Montgomery had never been ambitious; but independent in principles, and liberal in his
disposition, his warm heart panted to be the protector of all around; and his sanguine fancy had
often pourtrayed, in the gayest tints, that picture of domestic felicity, which could not be
completed, unless a gentle being, like Mary Cuthbert, had formed the prominent figure of the
piece. Alas! this picture was now obscured for ever. While such had been the gloomy images of Montgomery's mind, the letter of Miss
Moreton had been put into his hand. He read it with the eagerness of a drowning wretch, who
catches at a twig to preserve him from the overwhelming wave. He saw in it only a description of
his affection for Mary Cuthbert, he saw (transporting sight!) that the dear maid returned his love! That Miss Moreton, her protectress, favoured it, and meant to reward it! Who can wonder at this
misconstruction of the letter of Miss Moreton? Who can wonder that it was some days ere
Montgomery became convinced of his mistake? The interment of Mr. Montgomery had been succeeded by that calm which casts so
chilling a feel on those who have recently witnessed the spectacle of human annihilation, and
who mourn the loss of a beloved friend. Although autumn had scarcely began to tint the foliage
with its varied hues of brown and orange; yet the forlorn group at Elmsly had drawn round a fire
towards the evening; and whilst the tears were silently coursing down the cheeks of Mrs.
Montgomery, her two elder girls were trying to repress their own feelings, and to engage their
younger sister and brother, by artless prattle, to cheat their mother of her cares. Frederic had strolled out; and the tempestuous appearance of the evening, as viewed from
the high and tremendous cliffs which overlooked the sea; the rolling of the mountainous surge,
and the roaring of the winds, had been more congenial to the present tenor of his mind, than that
stagnant calm which reigned throughout his late happy home. A post-chaise drove up to
parsonage gate; the bell rang violently; a servant entered the parlour; "A lady, Ma'am, wishes to
see you," said the maid. "I can see no visitors," said Mrs. Montgomery, in a desponding tone-
"But she is here, Madam," replied the maid.
