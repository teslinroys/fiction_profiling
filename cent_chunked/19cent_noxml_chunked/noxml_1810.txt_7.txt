"-"I, my dear?" exclaimed her ladyship; "yes, I am the most
romantic creature living; but quite in a different way; I never go beyond probability; and
the romances I peruse, shew me, if not the exact picture of human life, at least what it
ought to be: I'll send you some of my books; they will not stuff your brain with ideas of
ghosts, magic and witchcraft; but will ennoble your ideas, enlarge your understanding,
and teach you how to charm, and not so like one of the antiquated sybils you are so fond
of reading about." Lady Isabella had the art of giving a charm to all she uttered: Margaret was
convinced that all she said must be right; and she regarded her ladyship with the fondest
admiration; while she felt deeply confused at her own slatternly figure, as she looked on
the style and tasteful elegance of Lady Isabella's dress: she adjusted her tucker, smoothed
her dishevelled hair, as well as she could, with her fingers! but casting her eyes
downwards, she saw two defects in her light pink striped gown, which she could not then
possibly repair; one was a greasy spot, in circumference of about an half-crown piece; the
other a large hole, much the same size, which she had burnt as she stood over the kitchen
fire reading, after having given some orders to the cook-maid, and which had been caused
by the red-hot poker; while just before, she had unconsciously dipped the other end in the
dripping-pan, being herself wholly absorbed in the study of her favourite romance. However, spite of her grotesque figure, Lady Isabella continued to caress her, as
she wanted to make both a tool and a fool of her. She took care to tell the silly and
credulous girl, in the course of their conversation, that Sir Charles Sefton was desperately
in love with her. "Indeed, my lady," said Margaret, "I cannot think it; though to be sure, I must tell
you, that the evening of Mr. Leslie's ball, I really did think something; but, dear me, he
never took the least notice of me in the world the other night, but even turned his back
upon me!" "I can tell you, my love, the reason of all that," said the crafty Isabella; "you must
know, my wise brother-in-law, Mr. Leslie, is desirous that I should marry the charming
Sir Charles Sefton, whose heart is so devoted to you; but we neither of us like one
another: well! my brother had taken upon himself the delightful task of watching us both
that night; and therefore, Sir Charles, at my intreaties, never once looked towards you." "Well, I don't know how it is; but I must say, I did rather like him," said the imprudent
Margaret, who knew not the artifice of her ladyship; "but I thought he was afraid of Mrs.
Kennedy; he told me once she was a --." "She is," interrupted Lady Isabella, "the
dearest creature in the world!" For Lady Isabella knew not that Sir Charles had carried his
quizzing powers so far, as to persuade Margaret into a belief of Mrs. Kennedy being
skilled in the black art-and Lady Isabella often found her that safe confidential friend,
who, while she patiently endured all her sarcasms, would also, while she concealed the
many improper secrets Lady Isabella confided to her, be not only silent, but as far as lay
in her power, assisting likewise: thus, though Lady Isabella inwardly despised the
pliability of her principles, ridiculed her person, and some of her flights of imagination in
her writings, yet she ever pretended for her the most kind and disinterested friendship. "Pray, my lady," said the pondering Margaret, "who did she mean by the rich
gentleman, older than myself, who would have evil designs upon me?" "Not Sir Charles,
you may be certain," replied Lady Isabella; "he loves you too well to injure you in the
smallest degree: no, he, I am sure, will study nothing but your happiness: though I do not
implicitly believe all that Mrs. Kennedy may tell with the cards, yet sometimes, I assure
you, she does hit right; but then, I believe, that is all by mere chance! and what, indeed, is
it but chance that governs our destiny?" Lady Isabella now perceiving that she had impressed Margaret with every idea she
could wish respecting Sir Charles, proposed returning to the house, promising to send her
the books as soon as she arrived at the parsonage. It may be easily seen, that from taking an improper bent, the refined understanding
of Lady Isabella was perverted to the worst of purposes, and the pernicious works she
perused, the ill example of her nearest relatives, and a naturally mischievous disposition,
all combined to corrupt her heart, and render her careless of future consequences, so as
she could but achieve her desired pursuit. That heart had a degree of warmth which made
love requisite to the happiness of her existence; she had loved Major Raymond, but she
never had regarded any man with that degree of partiality which she felt for Frederic
Harrington. Her penetration was most quick and acute; she saw, after the last visit of the
farm-house family to the parsonage, that the heart of Frederic was lost to her for ever; she
had suspected it, at the preceding visit, but she hoped, if it had only strayed from her, she
should yet be able to recover it: now, her wounded pride made her fixed in the resolution


to spurn him from her, even if she saw him sighing at her feet in despair. She was resolved in private to give Raymond every hope; while in public she
must affect to receive the addresses of Sir Charles Sefton with pleasure and satisfaction;
though she inwardly detested him, and put every art in practice to rid herself of a lover so
very uncongenial to her taste. She determined, if possible, to drive him into some kind of intrigue, which might
take up his time and attention; and it will be thought strange that she should pitch upon
Margaret for this manoeuvre: but she saw that the girl, if she took proper care of her
person, was by no means disagreeable: she knew also that Sir Charles Sefton was a
professed admirer of all the sex, and doted on variety, in whatever female form it
appeared, that was not downright ugly and deformed; Margaret Marsham, four years
younger than Lady Isabella, was just his favourite age, and a coral lip quite seduced him;
such had Margaret. The perfidious lady designed first to delude her mind with those seductive novels,
whose chief subject is love, and that was generally produced by beauty; and these novels
did not always make marriage the finale of the piece, but rather taught the young mind to
lean to love unrestrained and unlimited-
"Love, free as air. "-
Lady Isabella, to aid her own plot, and gratify her revenge on the lovely Mary, for
robbing her of the heart of Frederic, cared not one straw whether or no she was the ruin of
a poor innocent credulous girl, or for any afflictions she might heap on her family: such,
such alas! are the fatal principles which sway the mind of that being who gives herself up
to the free indulgence of her inclinations; who makes use of a brilliant understanding, by
daring to doubt an hereafter, flies in the face of her God, while she spurns decorum and
every moral tie and obligation: pride, vanity, and revenge, throw in their baneful
ingredients, and render a compound of all that is base and dishonourable. Into these digressive reflections we are, perhaps, too often led, in the depicting
characters, some of which, we are sorry to write it, are actually in existence-we
acknowledge that we ought to leave it to the minds of our readers to make what
comments they please, and which will present themselves differently to differing
dispositions. Lady Isabella, after some general and polite conversation with the worthy family
of Eglantine Farm, walked home, accompanied by Frederic Harrington; he proved but a
very stupid companion for her, and in vain he endeavoured to say something civil; she
saw through it all, and regarded him only with contempt, though with such well-assumed
indifference, that a less honest heart than Harrington's might have been deceived. In about half an hour after her arrival at home, came a packet of novels to the
farm-house, which, though of modern date, were not of that modern kind to lash at vice
and strip it of its beauteous mask; no, they consisted of such as would delude the weak
and unwary mind to dislike the formal ties of marriage, and, if so tied, to meditate
adultery; to break through the prudent bands of parental restraint, and give up all to love,
which so far from being branded by these seductive writers with the title of illicit, was


styled virtuous; though scoffing at the idea of nuptial chains, and confiding only in the
honour of the betrayer. Amongst these works was Madame de Staï¿½l's dangerous novel of Delphine; and
also that no less dangerous work (unless when perused by a young female of uncommon
purity and strength of mind), Rousseau's Heloise. Nor can we quite agree with that great
man, when he says, "the heart of a female, who should be corrupted by that work, was
corrupt before." The expression is far too strong: youth is not the season for firmness; extreme
prudence in the morning of life, is a virtue as unnatural as it is rare: the weak mind of an
inexperienced country girl may be softened and easily warped, which never was wicked,
or in any degree corrupt. Margaret read these works with avidity; she laughed at, she ridiculed herself, and
her former taste! but she languished for a congenial soul of the opposite sex, with whom
she could experience the extatic raptures proceeding from the unrestrained and delightful
union of hearts, where no vulgar "human tie" should render common their moments of
superlative bliss! Among other books, Lady Isabella lent her victim a few translations from the
French, wherein she found the heroine generally a married woman; this served to
strengthen her in the opinion of the invalidity and futility of the marriage-ceremony. She
found every coquettish art was put in practice by these Gallic nymphs, to ensnare the
hearts of men: Margaret, therefore, became more careful of her outward appearance;
studied long before her glass each look that might be most becoming: she was cautious of
opening her mouth, but smiled prettily, with her lips closed; her eyes were no longer
rolled towards heaven, but taught to speak the languor of earthly love, or sometimes to
leer with meaning and vivacity: it has before been observed, they were naturally good. Her animation and the improvement of her personal appearance astonished her
friends, for she was cunning enough to conceal, and study in private, the sources of her
present transformation: as the morals of her once cherished romances were irreproachable
and strict in the extreme, so her father never had forbidden their perusal; but she well
knew how much her present readings condemned the pure principles he preached from
the pulpit, and which actuated his private life. Mary, though her colour faded, appeared yet more sweetly interesting than ever:
Margaret's studies, wholly confined to the books she had borrowed from Lady Isabella,
left the choice which the circulating library afforded entirely to Mary; who sent always
for those novels whose subject was the softer passion; but then it was always virtuous
love and its reward which they described. Poems, also, she read, whose delightful
pensiveness suited the present turn of her mind; and it was the song of love alone which
now breathed its notes from her harmonious voice. I forbid my tears: but yet
It is our trick; Nature her custom holds,
Let shame say what it will. SHAKESPEARE. -------These reside
In courts, and do their works with bows and smiles;
That little engin'ry, more mischievous
Than fleets and armies. YOUNG. THE worthy Sir Edward Harrington had, from his first meeting with Charles
Marsham, determined to exert all his influence and interest with the great, to procure for
this excellent officer a lucrative and respectable situation. An appointment of great trust and importance was, at length, at the baronet's
intercession, bestowed upon him, and in which post he was to accompany the grand
expedition. The news arrived to Charles as sudden and unexpected as it was gratifying
and pleasing, and he hastened to join the fleet, which was daily expected to sail, and fill a
situation for which he was, from both abilities and experience, so amply qualified. The brothers at the farm-house had all of them a property, formerly belonging to a
deceased sister, equally divided between them, in an annual income: this deed of gift was
necessary to be perused and copied before their separation; a power of attorney was also
to be made out, and which Ralph, though the eldest, with a kind of presentiment on his
spirits, insisted on being given to his brother Edward. These papers were the cause which occasioned their delay, in waiting on the noble
guests who did them the honour of a morning visit previous to the week fixed for the
departure of Charles. The sorrows of the hitherto cheerful Mary seemed now begun; she
was the favourite of her uncle Charles, and, next to her father, she loved him. He pressed her, at parting, to his heart; and gave her, with parental fondness, his
blessing and advice, which sufficiently proved he had penetrated into the causes of the
present change in her person and manners, while the last sentence he flatteringly
pronounced, was, "Oh! my beloved Mary, guard your heart!" More than thrice did the secret mount to her lips, but female bashfulness as often
prevented its escaping them; she longed to confide her thoughts to her dear uncle, yet she
suffered him to quit her, with the corroding secret of her heart yet unrevealed. She looked anxiously at her window as he turned the corner of the lane which led
into the London road, and saw the last flutter of his white handkerchief, as, with an halfaverted
head, he waved the signal towards her; and while she could distinguish the
clattering sound made by the hoofs of his favourite mare, he did not yet appear as quite
departed. The dead silence that ensued made her tears stream afresh, and though still


blessed with a kind uncle and a worthy and affectionate parent, she felt at that moment as
if left alone in the world without a single friend. She leaned her aching head against the little book-case which contained the
instructive library her generous uncle had given her; kissed the lettered backs of some of
the volumes, and gave herself up to all the indulgence of sorrow; for she well knew that
each of the inhabitants of the farm, wholly occupied with their own regret and anxiety,
could afford her but little comfort. No one in Mr. Marsham's mansion could be more generally missed, nor could the
absence of any one be more regretted, than that of Charles; his constant cheerfulness, his
benevolent and truly humane heart, his easy address and fund of military anecdote, made
his society always desirable, and the deprivation of it severely felt by his family. The
servants had a pleasure in preventing his wishes; and his nieces were both emulous of
performing for him every little office of kindness in their power: the shirts that were made
for uncle Charles were worked at with more diligence and pleasure than for any one else;
and they each would contend whose turn it was to twitch out the hair to mark C. M. on
his cambric pocket-handkerchiefs or cravats. A summons to tea took Mary from her library into the common parlour: her father
and uncle remarked her red and swoln eyes, but they remarked only in silence; while
uncle Ralph drew the tea-table with equal taciturnity towards her. Margaret's grief was more violent, but Margaret was not now under the influence
of an artificial character; she was herself, she was a Marsham; and her bosom was only
warmed and animated by natural affections; her arms were crossed on a table, and she
sobbed bitterly as she rested her face upon them. Edward, after refusing the bread and butter which was handed to him, broke
silence by saying, "I shall eagerly look at the ship-news in every newspaper that arrives." "And will you believe," said Ralph, drily, "any thing that those vehicles of falsehood may
utter? especially when you must recollect how often they deceived us in the late Corunna
business!" "The nautical intelligence, as it comes from Lloyd's," said Edward, "is the only
part which may be almost implicitly relied upon." Ralph sipped his tea, and nodded, for he could not articulate an assent: the weight
of his heart sunk like lead in his bosom; yet, unlike that ponderous metal, it rose to his
throat, and seemed to choak the passage of utterance: his matter-of-fact character would
not suffer him to let it be perceived that an heavy presage appeared to speak to his
convicted mind, that he never should behold his much loved brother again. They all retired early to rest; and for a few days, their several most favourite
occupations lost their charms; but Charles wrote to one or other of them by every post,
and the described happiness of his much ameliorated situation, the flow of high spirits
which ran through his letters, made them participate in his felicity! though it cost them
the sacrifice of his society. In the mean time, the plotting Lady Isabella was not idle; Sir Charles, through her
artful persuasions and pretended love of quizzing, had had two or three stolen interviews
with Margaret: the false character of a girl from the country had often been imposed upon
him in town, in his purchased amours; here he found it in its true, its native simplicity and
credulity: Margaret's youth and virgin innocence were sufficient to please the taste of the


moment in this depraved libertine; he harboured against the unsuspecting girl the basest
designs; and while he laid his iniquitous plans to effect her ruin, he meant his short-lived
attachment to her to be as transitory and fleeting as the passion with which she had
inspired him; their sudden separation as momentary as the first impulse which urged him
to attempt her seduction! and as totally oblivious, on his part, as it might be agonising on
hers. Raymond, young, thoughtless, and insinuating, was now again reinstated in the
heart of Lady Isabella: Sir Charles was engaged with his new intrigue as deeply as her
ladyship could wish; so that he had neither time nor inclination to watch her movements. Every plan was laid by Lady Isabella and her lover for a trip to Gretna Green,
where the enamoured Raymond was to receive her vows for life, under the sanction of the
hymeneal Vulcan of that celebrated place for stolen weddings: but how to compass this
northern tour was the most difficult! for Lady Isabella had not been so circumspect, but
that her brother and sister began strongly to suspect that her tenderness for Major
Raymond was again revived: the Major's visits, also, became so frequent, as to draw on
him cool and averted looks, peevish contradictions, and distant and unrepeated invitations
to stay dinner or supper, when he might chance to call near the hours of either. The Rector and his lady always slept in separate apartments; Lady Caroline had
experienced of late very sleepless nights, could not rest alone, she must have her dear
Isabel with her; so that Isabella began to fear it would be impossible to effect her escape
from the country; and she knew it would be impracticable for the Major to obtain leave of
absence for such a length of time, which might enable him, on their removal from
Eglantine, to watch the different occasions which might offer, of carrying off his divinity
without molestation. In the perplexity of her mind, one morning, as Lady Isabella lay ruminating on her
pillow, a golden thought on a sudden struck her;-she rose, and repairing to the study,
she sent for Sir Charles Sefton's servant, to request from her his master to rise, and take a
walk with her on the lawn, as the morning was uncommonly beautiful. Sir Charles, ever joyful to obey the wishes of the object of his adoration, rose
immediately; but was surprised to see a thick and cloudy atmosphere, and a morning very
far from a pleasant one; however, if his beloved chose to call winter summer, or to call a
thick fog beautifully clear, it was his duty to acquiesce. "My dear Charles," said she, extending her delicate hand as he entered, while the
sentence thrilled to his soul; "I hope I have not interrupted any pleasant visions; but I
want to have a little conversation with you; and I am about to require your assistance in a
matter which, I assure you, interests my wishes so much, that I have been unable to sleep
the whole night." "Believe me," said the enamoured Baronet, while he endeavoured to look all that
was tender and captivating, "that I feel blessed beyond conception, that it is in my power
to afford any assistance to the wishes of Lady Isabella Emerson; and believe me, most
adorable of women, that not only my person and fortune, but my life is at her disposal. "-
"Oh! it is not a boon so precious as your existence which I have to beg," said the
bewitching Isabella, with the smile of an Hebï¿½, "no; but you know my brother-in-law
consents to every thing which you propose; and I wish you to exert your influence with
him, to let us, before we quit this place, have a masquerade on the lawn!" "Indeed, Lady Isabella," said Sir Charles, in a tone of tender reproach, "Mr.
Harrington was the person to have influence over Mr. Leslie; mine, I must say, in this
family, appears to be lost!" "Well! but you know," said she, affecting not to understand him, "he is not here,
or I certainly would have applied to him rather than to you. "-"Would you?" replied the
Baronet, with a desponding look.-"Assuredly," said she, "from the very unaccountable
influence, my dearest fellow, which he had over my brother and sister." Lady Isabella's art, in this morning's adventure, shone conspicuous: she had
appointed the study as the place of assignation with Sir Charles; she knew her brother's
hour of rising, and she knew also, that now that hour was just on the point of striking; and
he generally repaired to his library and studied half an hour, or more, before breakfast. Her deshabille was negligently elegant; a stray ringlet or two were suffered to sport from
beneath the pale blue Turkish turban, which confined her luxuriance of hair: she threw
herself in a careless attitude, half lying, half sitting, on a purple satin library-sofa; and
while she raised her delicate fingers to play sportingly on the candelabra which stood
beside it, the snowy whiteness of her hand appeared dazzling: an ancle of the finest
symmetry, and well-formed little foot, derived new beauty from the soft kid morning boot
which embraced it. Sir Charles longed for the period when he could shew off such a goddess of
beauty and fashion, as his own, and when he could read in every morning print the
notoriety of the dashing and lovely Lady Isabella Sefton! Enraptured at the thought, and seeing an object before him that would have
imparted extasy to the most cynical and apathetic, he fell on his knees, seized the hand
which hung by her side, and pressed it with ardour to his lips and heart; entreating her to
name the happy day, when he might call her his. The softness of her consenting looks, accompanied with a gentle sigh, made Sir
Charles easily conceive that he might himself name the day, without any opposition on
the part of her ladyship: "Whatever day you please," said she, hiding her face, "in the
fortnight after our departure from this place. "-"Cruel Isabella," said he, "why so long
delay my happiness?"-"Oh! now," said she, with the most childish and affected
modesty, "you take advantage of my partiality for you: we will say, in a week then after
we leave Eglantine. The Baronet then insisted she should seal this promise with her lovely lips; and at
that moment, to the great satisfaction of her plotting ladyship, at that tender interval, her
reverend brother-in-law entered his study! With well-acted confusion, rose from the sofa and stood before him, the
apparently trembling Isabella. Sir Charles smiled, and said, "Oh! sir, your divine sister
has at length consented to name the period when she will bless me with her hand!" "These raptures, sir," said the Rector, endeavouring to look grave, while
satisfaction beamed from his eyes, "are very unbecoming in people of rank and fashion;
Lady Isabella Emerson is intitled to more respect; she is not yet, Sir Charles, your wife;
and the situation I found my sister in on the sofa, is very improper indeed for a woman of
her quality. I am happy, certainly, that she is sensible of the worth of a husband, such as
you will make her; but I must, in my house, beg more decorum of manners, while she is
yet in her single state." Lady Isabella retired in well-feigned confusion, inwardly rejoicing that her plan
had succeeded so far; and more disgusted with, and hating Sir Charles Sefton worse than
ever; who now, sure of her ladyship, plotted the carrying on his subaltern amour, as he
styled it to his confidential servant, with the little ugly grisette, Marsham! When he had sufficiently wrought on the pliability of this credulous girl's mind, it
was his intention to carry her off, and pretend to the Leslies some urgent business in
London: the masquerade, however, if he could but get that to bear, would render such a
step unnecessary, for the disguises and opportunities of this species of entertainment
would easily effect an elopement; and the same important business was in agitation, and
intended to be effected by Major Raymond and Lady Isabella; for she felt certain that Mr.
Leslie, secure in her attachment to Sir Charles Sefton, would invite the Major; if not, he
could come disguised: he would not be distinguished in the throng, and she should neither
be watched, nor in any degree suspected. They assembled at a late hour to breakfast. Lady Isabella, generally all life and
chat, took her chocolate in silence; the Rector was all good-humour, and wished to
encourage the modesty of his lovely sister-in-law to look up and smile; Sir Charles was
rapture too visible to be sincerely heartfelt; Mrs. Kennedy kept feeding the pug-dog. Lady Caroline, with the MORNING POST in her hand, looked off from the
perusal of fashionable intelligence, to ask what was the matter with them all! Her
Theodore described and explained the study scene, and again looked grave. "And what of
that?" said Lady Caroline, with all the unblushing effrontery of fashion; "Why, my dear
Isabella, you blush, and look as ridiculously bashful about it, as an awkward country girl! It gives me, however, really, sincere pleasure to hear that you have at last consented to
name the time, when you will make this worthy gentleman happy;" and giving a meaning
look to her husband, as she concluded her speech, and which he appeared perfectly well
to understand, the breakfast was dispatched in haste, and taking her sister by the arm, they
left the Baronet and the reverend gentleman together. "It looks d-lish odd, I must say, my dear fellow," began Mr. Leslie; "but I had,
this morning, a bill come in for above two hundred pounds, and till my next rents become
due, it will be very inconvenient for me to pay it: I would willingly have given my bond
for the payment of it, at that time, but the fellow insists on having his money immediately. If you could oblige me with the loan of three hundred pounds, I should esteem it a
singular favour? and I will give you a power to receive that sum when my next rents
become due. "-The Baronet was silent! The Reverend Theodore Leslie had never before asked to borrow any sum of Sir
Charles Sefton: reflection, with the rapidity of lightning, darted through his mind. "How,"
thought he, "did Sir Charles continue always so wealthy, giving, as he did, in to every
species of fashionable expence and amusement, unless he was very close indeed in many
other respects? But yet he had never seemed to care much about money; and though Lady
Isabella had a fortune, he appeared very willing to take her without any!" The Baronet's busy mind also underwent a quick succession of ideas; he did not
like to lend money, neither to give it away, unless to put in practice some very favourite
pursuit: but, to please his future lady, to obtain the masquerade he had promised her, if
possible, and the power this loan might give him over the Leslies, to do as he pleased; to


make their house his home, and invite thereto whoever he might think proper: all these
circumstances made him feign a generosity he by no means felt. "Well, my dear friend," said he, after a long, and to Mr. Leslie, a puzzling and
painful pause,-"and is this really all the mighty favour you have to ask of me? Be
assured, double that sum is yours, at pleasure." He then hastened to his writing-desk, and gave a bill on his banker, to be paid at
sight; but he did not double the sum, nor did he forget to take the proffered bond. However, with all his shallow principles, he knew it would be the height of
indelicacy, at that moment, to ask a favour in return; and reserved the masquerade scheme
till after dinner, when the cloth and servants should be withdrawn. In answer to his then strenuously urged request, the Reverend Theodore Leslie
said, "My dear Sir Charles, I have but one objection, that is the prejudice of the country
people: you well know, I am sure, and will acknowledge, that I have no aversion to any
one fashionable amusement in the world, au contraire, and many is the masquerade in
town that I have accompanied you to: but to have such a divertisement at the parsonage, I
fear will be inadmissible; nor can we accomplish it, I am sure, without giving offence to
these votaries of the old school; and it will cast a stigma on my professional character that
I know not how I should wipe off. Now there is Edward Marsham, for instance, my
curate; why, I suppose nothing on earth would make him bring his family to such an
entertainment! and I declare the good folks at the farm-house are the most decent people
in this place: I do not like to have a party without them; and that girl, Mary Marsham, is
an ornament to any circle, and indeed the other improves very much of late." Lady Caroline turned up her lip with a contemptuous sneer. "Oh!" said Lady
Isabella, "as to my little sensible Margaret, I quite love her! "-"And so do I, most
passionately," said the Baronet, half quizzing, half serious, as he watched the looks of his
Isabella, who, though inwardly pleased, pouted and affected to be jealous. Lady Caroline, who had seen much of his pointed attentions lately to Margaret,
eyed him with an archness which rather disconcerted him; but the badinante gaiety of her
tone relieved him, as she said,-"Now are you not a very pretty fellow, and likely to
make a most fashionable husband, since the time you only expect to obtain the title, you
talk of loving another passionately! Oh! I glory in such a charming disciple of the New
School." Lady Caroline's spirits were uncommonly buoyant since the morning loan; she
had also won a considerable bet on the exact colour of a horse, with a young fox-hunter
who had called just before dinner; she caused general mirth by some of her sprightly
sallies, given with all the originality and dash of the haut ton. The indefatigable Sir Charles again reverted to the subject of the masquerade. "I
have hit upon an expedient," said Mrs. Kennedy; "when I was in Ireland, we often used to
have fancy-balls: suppose Lady Caroline proposes to give such an entertainment! and
every one invited to it be requested to appear in character; you will thus avoid the stupid
throng of dominos; and instead of dancing on the lawn, let them dance in the ball-room,
where, when they are all assembled and ready to begin dancing, let Lady Caroline or Lady
Isabella propose some little change of disguises and present the company with masks. "-
"You are a dear creature, Kennedy," said Lady Isabella; "and therefore, dear brother,"
continued she, turning her persuasive and bewitching countenance full upon him, "let us


finish with this unique affair, as, by the week after, we shall most probably have quitted
this place; and, as this is but Tuesday, if we have it the latter end of next week, we shall
have time to collect a tolerable set, and to send to London for masks and many other
charming and requisite et-ceteras; which we must all be secret about, for I would not be
without the Marshams' family for the universe." "I am sorry the Lieutenant is gone," said Mr. Leslie; "there was a great deal of
originality and spirit about that fellow; I liked him much: but Sir Charles and Lady
Isabella were very glad he was gone: Lady Isabella, though she liked him, feared him
more; and Sir Charles knew he could better impose on the unsuspecting virtue of Edward,
and the simplicity of honest Ralph, than on the mind of a man who had mixed so much in
the world as Charles Marsham; whose high sense of honour would not tamely suffer any
insult offered to his family, nor endure the wrongs of a seduced niece with patience or
impunity."
