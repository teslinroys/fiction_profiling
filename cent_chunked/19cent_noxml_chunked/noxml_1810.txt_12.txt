When Charles Marsham quitted the farm-house, Mary had experienced a cruel
agony of heart, and she then thought that such an extent of affliction she could never feel
again: but how much more keen did she feel this separation! when she wept, for she could
not help weeping on the bosom of a beloved husband, and saw him depart from her, not
only with dry eyes, but with a visible emotion of pleasure, which he knew not how to
conceal; for Frederic Harrington, with all his faults, had no dissimulation about him. Those who have heard the dead sound of an hearse, as it carried from the door the
last remains of a friend, dearly and tenderly beloved, can only form to themselves what
were the feelings of this affectionate wife, as she heard the wheels of her Frederic's postchaise
drive from the cottage-gate; for not an hearse departing in all its still pomp of sable
woe, could more sink the heart with the leaded weight of grief, than the swift and rattling
sound of Harrington's travelling carriage did that of his Mary, at the moment of his
departure. Ashamed that her father should witness her tears, she hastened to her chamber;
and locking herself in, gave way to the indulgence of a sorrow she at length blamed
herself for, and could not help almost thinking ridiculous: she dressed herself, and
assumed what cheerfulness she could at dinner, till her father drank the health of Mr.
Harrington, as they were taking their dessert. He gently chid her for being so childish, as
not being able to bear her husband out of her sight, whose intended stay was but for a
very short period, and who had promised to write to her by every post. "We are capricious beings, my love," added Edward, "too apt to undervalue the
blessing, which is always in our undisputed possession. Let Mr. Harrington always find
you a kind, obliging and grateful wife; welcome him, ever, with cheerfulness: but if you
shew yourself too fond of him, depend upon it, such is the ingratitude of our sex, that his
love for you will decrease in proportion as he observes the increase of that excessive
fondness in you; for, by a visible anxiety to keep him always in your sight, you will make
him only particularly desirous of being out of it, and shewing himself oft in company,
where he would rather, perhaps, you did not make a part." Mary, though she could not restrain her tears, and which this last sentence of her
father had caused to stream afresh, yet promised, and secretly resolved to keep the
promise, of adopting that line of conduct, which he had marked out for her. The next day
her heart was comforted by a most kind and affectionate letter from her Frederic; the
succeeding ones made her equally happy; she perceived no diminution of his tenderness,
and, wrapped up in fancied security of his unaltered love, she grew gay and cheerful, and
passed her easy hours in the society of the friends she valued and esteemed. Lucy Ringwood, the companion of her earliest years, was dear to her, as a sister;
but she could not accept Mary's invitation of remaining with her during the absence of
Mr. Harrington, as she could not leave her beloved aunt alone; but a day seldom past, in
which these three friends did not mutually visit each other: on those occasions, when Mrs.
Susanna Bradbury was of the party, Lucy generally stole from them for about an hour or
more, which filled the minds of the two ladies with various surmises; though neither
spake her thoughts to the other. Edward, more and more delighted with his nephew, often left the female trio to
converse, not always on the requisite arrangement of dress and fashion, but often on those
slight, mental accomplishments, which are peculiarly adapted to their sex, and in which
the masculine understanding, however great its superiority, sometimes finds itself, in
brilliancy and quickness of idea, outdone. On those occasions, Edward repaired to the farm; and one day he found his,
generally, sprightly nephew in a serious, and indeed a melting mood; for his humid eyes
rested on a packet of papers which lay before him: these, he said, he had been just
developing the contents of, and presenting the packet to the Curate, he desired him to take
it home with him, and peruse it at his leisure. I saw her breast with every passion heave-
I left her; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Oh! my hard bosom that could bear to leave! SHENSTONE. The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,
Safest and seemliest by her husband stays;
Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. MILTON. FREDERIC HARRINGTON had not yet ceased to love his Mary with ardour, when he
threw himself into the post-chaise, which bore him from his cottage; he at first felt all the
delight of emancipation, but he had not proceeded many miles before he found a void in
his breast, and Mary presented herself to his fancy in all the sweet attractive influence of
her lovely form. Every pleasant scene recalled her to his imagination, and on every one of nature's
lovely views which he beheld as he passed through the country, he wanted his beloved
and constant companion to partake of his pleasure; and as there was a great similarity in
their tastes for rural landscapes, he wished her present, that they might mutually make
their remarks to each other. Just before he arrived at the inn, where he meant to stop for dinner, so sincerely
did he regret the loss of his Mary's society, that he was almost determined to take posthorses
back, and request her to accompany him on his little excursion: but how ridiculous
and how capricious he would look! and still worse, what a petticoat-governed husband! for Mary might mention among their acquaintance her agreeable surprise at his coming
back for her: it would never do!-no, he would write for her-that would be as bad: his
letter would always tell against him; it would give her and her family unbounded sway
over him. Harrington was a man of the world; he was, indeed, in some respects the world's
slave-and Mary was doomed to stay where she was. He ate for his dinner a morsel of fish, and the roast fowl went away untouched: he
tossed off three or four glasses of port, and his thoughts about Mary seemed drowned in


the last: he, therefore, leaped into the chaise, with a jocund air, and promised to make
himself amends at supper. He nodded in the chaise; and a dream brought his beloved Mary again by his side:
he cursed his stars when he awoke, that she was not really there; and as the setting sun
shot its departing rays over the heath, he dropped a few tears at the idea of his Mary-left
alone! He recalled her tender farewell-he execrated his own folly! while fashion, and
fashion's pleasures appeared poor indeed, when put in competition with her. But, as he stopped to supper, the remembrance of his wife, his blissful cottage, his
happy wedded state, vanished at one instant, and swift as the lightning's flash. Some of
his former dashing companions were at the inn; renowned members of the whip-club,
who had just been taking their dinner there; and were all getting completely forward in
the service of the god of wine. They all hailed him by the title of "Benedick, the married man!" but hoped he had
not become a sober-sides; they applauded him for his courage, in so soon breaking his
fetters, though composed only of the roses and myrtle of love; and added, that however
charming was the pretty little grisette he had married, yet he did right to let her know in
time how he meant to act. Mr. Harrington, however, did not look well pleased, to hear his wife denominated
a grisette! and he repeated the term in that way which shewed he was offended. "Nay,
d-n it!" said Lord Armitage, "it was only what we heard: come, come, you shall not be
sparring with us-we'll have no more duels; Mrs. Harrington must ever challenge our
sincere respect, as your wife; and forgive, I beseech you, us set of choice spirits, if we
chanced to make use of an improper term: why, my buck, you and I have been old fellow
school-mates! a fig for all women, be they wives, maids, or widows! Come, we must
initiate you in the rules of our club! our favourites* are of the four-legged breed; we toast
none of your capricious females, either of town or country-but pass about the bottle to
Frolicksome Fan, Betty slim-legs, Jack the Crop, and Jemmy Twitcher; all quadruped
favourites of the whipping sport-four-in-hand, my fine fellow, four-in-hand! that's the
present order of the day. I made a figure of eight* this morning five times going; won two
hundred pounds of Ned Needham; look, how glum he sits there at the corner of the
table!" Harrington could not forbear laughing at the rattling peer; and taking his seat
amongst them, he took a couple of glasses of champaign with them, and then bespoke an
expensive supper for them all. The orgies of Bacchus continued till the dawn of the next
morning, and they all reeled off to their several chambers, declaring Harrington the finest
fellow in the world; and that, if they were sure matrimony would spoil them, no more
than it did him, they would all set off on the morrow, in search of some rich dowager, to
help to support the expences of the whip! Before Frederic rose to breakfast his boisterous companions had departed; and a
violent head-ach prevented him from finishing his journey that day: he could not help
contrasting the scene he had just witnessed, and in which he had borne a part, with the
tranquil and self-approving pleasures of his dear cottage; and he penned that first tender
letter to Mary, which she received with so much delight. * Historique. * Historique. He arrived early the next morning at his place of destination: the beautiful and
picturesque situation of Cromer again made him wish for Mary, to participate in the
sublime kind of pleasure which it imparted to his mind. He did not bathe that day, but
returned to his inn; and in the evening dressed himself, and took a walk, at the going out
of the tide, to observe with an awe-felt curiosity, if he could perceive any vestiges of a
part of the old town and church that were overwhelmed by an influx of the sea a
considerable number of years since*. As he walked onwards, a very elegant female passed him, leaning on the arm of
an officer; the gentleman appeared a veteran, had been handsome, and bore about him
that evident look of gallantry which shewed he had been un homme aux bonnes fortunes
in his day. There was a dignity in his appearance which bespoke him of rank in his
profession, and a kind of air which thoroughly marked the man of high birth. The form of
the lady was not only elegant, but was exquisitely fine: what little Frederic could see of
her face, which was much hid by a lace veil, appeared young and very beautiful; Frederic
fancied he had seen one like it, though he had now so very partial a view of that which
was almost hid, as the lady passed him: however, the old town, the church, all was forgot,
in this more lovely and modern piece of divine workmanship. Frederic retired to his lodgings; and a sentiment beyond curiosity actuated the
whole of his thoughts and ideas. The evening was sultry, he threw up the sash, and seated
himself to enjoy a moonlight scene of uncommon beauty, and which, in another frame of
mind, would have recalled all his forsaken pleasures of rural life; but now, not one inmate
of his cottage shot their calm remembrance across his agitated heart. Several carriages passed by in hurried succession: he called up his landlady, and
asked her what it meant? "They are going to the assembly, sir," said she; "there is a grand
ball and supper given there to-night by the great general, Lord Fenwater, to the officers of
a regiment, who arrived here last week: I forget the name of the regiment, for we have
such a power of soldiers now coming, one after the other, all round the coast, that I am
sure it so bewilders my poor brains that I do not know the one from the other! Ah, Lord
help us! sir, the General is old enough, I believe, to be your grandfather: but I am sure he
is turned fool; saving your presence, sir, for speaking so of any gentleman; and is fallen in
love with a beautiful young creature in the regiment; and it's all along with she, that he
gives this fine ball and supper: for I heard say as how he should say once, that he hated
that there regiment, and called them all a set of scamps! I think was his word; and he said
the officers' wives were all no better than a fusty set of old maids." "Lord Fenwater!" exclaimed Frederic, who, though he was weary of the good
dame's prolixity, yet wanted to hear more, as he was now convinced that this was the
nobleman he had seen in the morning with this lovely unknown. "Sit down, my good
madam," continued Frederic, "and do tell me about this inconsiderate old peer, of whom I
know very little, only that he is a friend of my uncle's, with whom I once saw him." "Why, sir, I must say, I does not know much good of him; for this lady is another
man's wife, and she is married to a very handsome young man; and I am told, it was quite
a love-match on both sides: now, sir, as I said before, though she is as beautiful a creature
as ever I clapped my eyes upon, yet I say, handsome is, that handsome does; and she does
* Historique. not do very handsomely, to give the General every encouragement; she does not care one
fig for her husband; nay, she left him one day on a sick bed, to drive out with the General
in his phaeton." "What is the lady's name?" said Frederic, with an ill-assumed indifference. "I
declare I almost forget, replied the landlady, "but I think it is Lady Arabella Hammond, or
somewhat very much like it. "-A loud knocking at the door put a period to this dialogue,
and a kind of consequential voice demanded if Mr. Harrington did not lodge there? and,
in the space of a moment, jumpt up-stairs, at three steps, the Honourable Mr. Lawson, an
old fellow-collegian, and intimate friend of the gay Frederic. "Why, what in the d--l's name, Fred," said Lawson, "is it I have heard? I am
told you are married! and yet not wedded to the dear dashing female who so much
captivated you, and whom every one declared was expressly made for you; that
resplendent beauty, the Isabella Emerson! Come, where's the bewitching creature that has
transplanted her? and whom you have honoured by dubbing Mrs. Harrington! cannot one
have a peep at her? or do you keep her locked up in a glass case, for fear any one should
touch her?" "Mrs. Harrington is not with me," replied Frederic, half abashed; inwardly vexed
at his hasty marriage, yet rejoiced to see his friend; and almost wishing that he had
married a female of Lady Isabella's shining and fashionable exterior. "Bravo! Bravissimo!" said Lawson; "well, now this is something like a modern husband; broke
your fetters already! hang me, if I do not believe you have united yourself to some rich
dowager of quality, who has with you made the delightful, mutual compact, of letting
each act as shall best please the other." "No such thing," said Frederic; "let us, for a
moment, dear friend, be serious; I have married a young girl, whose lovely person is far
inferior to all her other attractions! her face and form, all charming as they are, sink into
nothing, when compared with the virtues of her pure and spotless mind! and-" "Whew!" interrupted Lawson, "how long will this fit be upon you? Do not you recollect, my dear
fellow, that I always compared your mind to a rainbow? a charming diversity of sentiment
coloured it, but yet only tinged it, like that beautiful arch; for it could boast equal
instability: its firmness was as easily dissolved by the tears of impulsive mistaken
sensibility, as its brighter hues were, at other times, obscured by a shower of
intemperance, or by an accidental dark cloud of gravity, which might throw a shadow
over it: while the bright sun of pleasure has triumphed in its splendour; and the
sentimental tints of Frederic Harrington's rainbow were all lost!" "Have you done?" said Harrington, smiling; "or is this a part of some old theme
that was given you when at Oxford? Come, a truce to metaphor;-pray why are you thus
accoutered? upon my honour, vous �tes bravement equip�!" "Yes, yes," said Lawson; "a truce, my dear fellow, to every thing but present
pleasure: I have a ticket from the amourous old General, Lord Fenwater, to a ball he gives
this evening: with this ticket I received a very polite note, earnestly requesting me to
attend, and to bring with me any friend I thought proper: hasten then to thy toilette, thou
Adonis, formed to please the fair; forget thou art married, and equip thyself to accompany
me." Harrington was soon persuaded; away they drove to the assembly-room: Frederic
Harrington more elegant, infinitely more pleasing and interesting than when in full health,


derived new attractive powers from his suit of mourning; and in this guise he entered the
ball-room. Thus interesting, thus attractive, the first object which met his eyes, increased in
loveliness with every auxiliary of the most tasteful and superb attire, was Lady Isabella
Raymond! She was seated on a sofa at the upper end of the room, behind which gracefully
leaned the fine martial figure of the General, who was dealing out to her all the pretty
compliments of gallantry which he had practised for thirty years amongst twice that
number of different females. Lawson advanced towards him with all the familiarity of an
old acquaintance, and waving his hand towards Frederic, he said, "Permit me, my lord, to
introduce my friend, Mr. Harrington, to your notice." "I have had the honour of seeing
Mr. Harrington before, with his worthy uncle, Sir Edward," said the General, with visible
coldness; his penetrating eye having observed the changes and emotion of Lady Isabella's
and Harrington's countenances. Frederic, however, on the invitation of her ladyship,
which was given with all the nonchalance she could assume, threw himself gracefully on
the vacant seat beside her. "Ah! ah!" said Lawson, "Lady Isabella, do you know my
quondam friend with his pale visage, and garb of woe?" "Oh!"
