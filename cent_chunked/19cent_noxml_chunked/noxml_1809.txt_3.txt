THOMSON. MARY was soon arrayed; and, perceiving that the parlour had been vacated by Mrs.
Deborah Moreton, she followed her into the Lyceum, which she understood to be the
general sitting room. At the top of the apartment, on a large chair, sat Mrs. Deborah
Moreton; her head was erect, her unbending brows exhibited a picture of stern severity;
her hands were folded before her; and, neither turning to the right or to the left, there was
a magisterial dignity and hauteur about her, which was calculated to intimidate, and to
awe all those around her; but, perfectly easy and free in manners, as in morals, none of
the company appeared to regard her, except Copy, who had placed himself as directly
opposite to Mrs. Deborah, as he had been to Mary Cuthbert on the preceding evening,
only that, instead of advancing gradually towards the old lady, as he had done towards the
young one, he made a retrograde motion, as he perceived the curve on the forehead
become stronger, and the lines more deeply marked over the rest of the features; and from
time to time, he muttered to himself-"yes, stern, and unrelenting; these are the
characteristic marks of her countenance; something of a Popish hat on her head, the cross,
and the rosary.-The centre picture for the other two: Gardiner at the right hand-Bonner
on the left-Queen Mary in the middle, the best I ever saw; not a smile, not the smallest
relaxation of muscle-three quarters length-she will do, yes, yes, she will do!" and he
began a long and uninterrupted whistle, as the rest of the company, engaged by their own
amusements and pursuits, looked not at the ideal painter. Miss Moreton was recumbent on an Ottoman; near her stood Walwyn, while the
humble Chevalier, in all the flow of sentiment, had sunk on the carpet at her feet. Mr.
Germ had a large folio of coloured plates before him, and was comparing his specimens
with their descriptions; while his pockets were stuffed out like wallets; and he had books
piled on each side of the carpet as he sat. Montgomery stood at a window; the Signora
had not yet made her appearance; Mary Cuthbert felt a little awed at the unbending
stiffness of Mrs. Deborah Moreton, and at being thus obliged to make her entre� before
the company; but Miss Moreton immediately beckoned her towards her, and taking her
hand, would have seated her at her side; while Captain Walwyn and Mr. Montgomery
eagerly advanced, and, in the politest manner, made inquiries after her health. "You received my billet this morning, my dear Mary," said Miss Moreton; "I was
sorry to be obliged to leave you entirely to yourself, but should have been quite au de
despoir, if the Chevalier had not read to me an hour or two, in the divinest work which
ever issued from a Parisian press!" "You had much better take a seat by me, child," said Mrs. Deborah Moreton,
calling to Mary; "here is much the fittest place for you." "Don't think of leaving us Mary," said Miss Moreton. "Mrs. Deborah Moreton is,
you see, quite deserted," said Mary: "and as she has been so kind as to give me her
company this morning, I must not neglect her now." "Oh, by all means, go," said Miss Moreton, Mary obeyed; and though the
disappointed look of Montgomery might have told her, had she taken notice of it, that he
wished her to remain in her former station, yet she felt gratified in shewing some
attention to the old lady, when she saw her entirely neglected by the rest of the company. Dinner was at length announced. "The Signora is not ready," said Miss Moreton,
"let the Signora know;" and she remained on the Ottoman, while Mrs. Deborah Moreton
rose from her chair, and sailed with slow movement into the dining room; Germ seemed
to understand her meaning, and hastily pocketing his specimens, he strided after her. "We
must go, I perceive," said Miss Moreton, giving one hand to Walwyn, and helping the
Chevalier to rise with the other; as if by an involuntary movement, Montgomery took the
hand of Mary to lead her into the dining room; and Monsieur Myrtilla, skipping away,
said, "Where can ma chere Signora be all this great long time? She vas finish de rouge
and de patch, ven I saw her last!" and all the way up the stair-case, he danced, calling,
"Ma Signora, Ma Signora-dinner be quite ready; dinner be waiting for you, Ma chere
Signora!" At the right hand of the table stood Mrs. Deborah Moreton, waiting for her niece
to head it, and to hear grace. "I go to the side to-day," said Miss Moreton; "Mr. Germ be
so good as to help the fish." Mr. Germ obeyed. "Indeed, Walwyn," continued she, "my
spouting has nearly incapacitated me for any more exertion to-day; there is a great deal of
violent action in that last scene!" "Who says grace, Miss Moreton?" asked Mrs. Deborah, still standing. "Who is the
chaplain, niece?" "My dear Madam, it is entirely out of fashion, quite exploded; it is never attended
to when said." "It is a custom more honoured in the breach, than the observance," said
Walwyn. "And the fish is spoiling," said Germ. "Can't you say grace, child?" asked Mrs.
Deborah Moreton, turning towards Mary Cuthbert. "I can, Madam," said Montgomery,
with the utmost promptitude. He said a short grace, in a distinct and serious tone. "Thank you, Sir," said the old lady; "here is a chair at your service, between me
and this young lady." Miss Moreton was seated between Walwyn and the Chevalier; Mr. Copy was at the bottom of the table; but, instead of carving, he was whistling, and taking
the character of Germ's face ideally on canvass. The Signora at length entered, led by Monsieur. "It vas all of von obstinate little
lock, which so cruelly detained the Signora," said he; "she has been one, two, tree, whole
hours in disposing to her wishes." The Signora scarcely noticed the party; but, seating
herself, called for a glass of Madeira, while the attentive Monsieur kept tempting her
palate, by praising the numerous dishes of which he ate. Montgomery was pleasant, and
well bred; he paid Mrs. Deborah Moreton proper respect and attention, whilst he did not
overlook his fair neighbour; and insensibly, the old lady's countenance relaxed a little of
its accustomed sternness, at meeting with such unusual politeness at the Villa; and, on her
re-entering the Lyceum after dinner with Mary Cuthbert, she declared that she had never
dined so decently with her niece before. "That Mr. Montgomery is a civil, well-behaved
young man," said she; "and I only can wonder what can have brought him here?" "On Mrs. Deborah's rising to leave the gentlemen, the Chevalier D'Aubert had
taken the hand of Miss Moreton, it never being his custom to sit after dinner; and the

Signora Grosera had re-filled her glass, it not being her's to leave the Monsieur Myrtilla
to a solo over his wine. After a sentimental t�te-a-t�te between the Chevalier and Miss Moreton in the
viranda, the Chevalier quitted the room. "Pray, niece," said Mrs. Deborah, "is that Mr.
Dobbert a married or a single man?" "Heavens, Madam! do you think I ever asked him
the question?" "I should think it a very natural one, Miss Moreton, admitted as he is,
upon such very familiar terms in your house; and to tell you the truth, which you know I
am very fond of doing, I have heard that he is certainly married, and that his wife is now
in England, and in the utmost distress." "Poor man! I pity him!" "Poor man?-Poor
woman, you should say," said Mrs. Deborah, "to be deserted by her husband, and that,
too, in a strange country!" "Dear Ma'am, what is country? a mere local distinction: to a
truly benevolent and liberal mind, this or that tract of land makes no more difference than
this or that potatoe." "Poor D'Aubert! joined, but not matched! How, how is my sympathy excited in
your melancholy fate!" "Miss Moreton-Miss Clary Moreton-" "How often, Madam,
have I desired, nay conjured you not to Clarify me!" "Fie, fie, Miss Moreton, are you
determined to act for ever in opposition to all the world? Will you still permit this wicked
diabolical Frenchman to intimacies which I blush only to think of, and, knowing that he
can never become your husband?" "Husband! What an idea! Madam, I never thought of him as my husband!" "Not as a husband? what then, child?-Miss Cuthbert, you had better quit the
room, before she confesses what you ought not to hear!" "Madam, the whole world, which you are so afraid of, may hear my sentiments. The friendship which exists between D'Aubert and myself is of a nature which common
and vulgar minds may not comprehend, nor do we desire they should. To level it to everyday
understandings, and to every-day practice, would destroy all the charming privacy of
its nature. Friendship, like our's, Mrs. Deborah Moreton, is the sweet confidence of
kindred souls. Benevolence and philanthropy first impelled me towards the suffering
Chevalier; but these feelings have long ceased to actuate me. In the prosecution of our
delicate and refined interchange of sentiments, I find all that can interest my heart, and
touch its softest emotions; and I glory in saying that the Chevalier D'Aubert is the very
sweetener of my existence." "Oh, monstrous, monstrous!" cried Mrs. Deborah. "You glory in your shame,
child; and if, as you say, you are really so wrapt up in this Dobbert; for what earthly
purpose have you brought back that rattling Captain again?" "For my amusement," said Miss Moreton, with the utmost non chalance; "While
D'Aubert is the friend of my soul, Walwyn is the companion of my lighter hours!" "Why, child, one would think, to hear you talk, that you had yielded yourself up, a
shameless wanton!" "That one must have very gross ideas then, Madam, and a most
depraved mind!" "And who is Mr. Montgomery, that sat by me; and who, to say the truth,
appears to be the best of the whole bunch; what is HE, I pray you? Is HE the friend of
your soul, or the companion of your lighter hours?" The crimson mounted to the cheeks of Mary uncalled for, as she heard this
question; Miss Moreton, she thought, seemed a little confused as she answered; "He is, at
present, neither the one or the other-if I was inclined, indeed, to chuse a companion for

my heavy hours, he might perhaps suit me; for he seems vastly grave, and wonderfully
solemn-however, heavy hours are best passed alone, I believe." "Then you are likely, one day, to have a very solitary time of it, child," said Mrs.
Deborah; "for when you shall reflect, how you have abused the talents, and slighted the
bounties, which have been given you-how you have perverted the blessings of Heaven,
and wasted your fortune on the profligate and the undeserving;-when your flatterers
shall have left you, and old age shall approach-"
"Pray, Madam, do not talk of old age," said Miss Moreton; "it is time enough for
me to think of that some years hence. I act up to the impulsive movements of my own
heart; I glory in being the protectress of the unfortunate, the fosterer of the distressed, and
the friend and patroness of genius-and, in the proud emotions of this moment, how
strikingly true do I feel the truth of the axiom, that, 'virtue is its own reward!' "What
vain, what proud self-boasting, do I hear?" said Mrs. Deborah. "Virtue! it is known to you
only by name; you have got a little high-sounding jargon by rote, and you use it like a
parrot on all occasions. The fosterer of the distressed, indeed! what humanity is there in
separating a husband from a wife, and feeding him on the fat of the land, while she
probably is starving for want of food?-Where is the merit of patronising men and
women, who are below the attention, and even the notice of all respectable characters?-
Oh, Miss Moreton, Miss Moreton, would you but learn a little Christian humility, it
would better become you than all the benevolence, the philanthropy, and the genius,
about which you rave so much. The only part of your conduct which I can commend, was
your accepting the office of guardian to this poor child. God grant that your example may
not operate to her destruction! There, now I have given you a piece of my mind, you may
take it as you like." "Just as usual, Madam," said Miss Moreton, 'the conscious mind is its own awful
world!' Nothing shall ever induce me to give up my friends to the antiquated and straitlaced
dogmas of the old school, which must be utterly exploded by all the proselytes of
refinement and sentiment." "I wish that word had never been uttered in England," said Mrs. Deborah
Moreton; "but I have done-I have spoken my mind!" "You have indeed," said Miss
Moreton, as rising from her seat, folding her arms, and lifting up her eyes, she began an
invocation, which was meant to appear as involuntary, but she was well aware, that the
company were all returning into the Lyceum, and that she had numerous hearers. "Would you (blest) Sensibility resign? And with those powers of Genius would
you part?" LANGHORNE. "OH, ye immortal Spirits of Sentiment! "cried the empassioned Clarissa; "Hear, oh! hear,
the profanation which has been offered to your Muses! Divine Petrarch! where, if
Sentiment had not existed, where would have been found those heart-piercing notes,
which, like the harmonious trillings of the nightingale, were wafted on the evening
breeze, in soft murmurings, through the woods of Vauclusa? In the absence of Sentiment,
where, oh! where had been the immortality of Rousseau? The genius of his inspiration
flown, in vain should we have sought for those polished periods, which will melt the
heart to tenderness and affection-Eloise-St. Preux-Unfortunate Lovers! your sorrows
would not have been excited by him; hearts of sensibility would not have known the
pause of exquisite rapture; they would not have shed the tear of exquisite, of refined
sympathy. Goethe too, then beloved writer!
