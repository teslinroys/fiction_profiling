"Mercy
on me, child," exclaimed she, "how you are drawn out. O dear, you must not dress so,
when we have only a family dinner at home." The servants soon began to discover that Miss Marsham could be nothing more
than an humble friend; they therefore forgot to change her plate: she had to call several
times for a glass of water or porter; and not one gentleman had yet asked her to take a
glass of wine, till Mrs. Davenport said to her husband, "Henry, I hope you take care of
Miss Marsham!" He then coldly asked her, if she chose to take any wine? but calling on
another lady to join them, he forgot to fill poor Margaret's glass from the decanter which
stood next him, and the cloth was removed before she had half finished her dinner, and
she had the prospect before her of starving in the midst of plenty. After dinner, Mrs. Davenport said, "Do, my dear child, help me to one of those
apricots which stand near you: what's your name? Margaret, I think, is not it? It is very
ugly. "-"My name, ma'am," replied Margaret, "is Margaritta. "-"Well, that is
something rather more tolerable." A new jargon of fashionable slang then took place, quite inexplicable to the silent
Margaret, with a confused kind of dissertation on various public places, which she had
never been at in her life; and various parties were proposed to the company, but she was
not included in the invitation. Mrs. Benworth and her daughter sat opposite to Margaret,


and frequently spoke together in a low voice, as they looked towards her, which added to
the unpleasantness of her situation. Mrs. Benworth had been a very fine woman, was a widow, and dearly loved the
attentions, and highly estimated the adulation of the opposite sex, though not quite in so
innocent a way as Mrs. Davenport; for the mind and ideas of Mrs. Benworth were coarse:
though she was always accustomed by birth and fortune, to move in the first circles, and
her education having been excellent, her gross defects were only perceptible to those who
had known her long. Miss Benworth was a sly-looking, silent girl, and observed a most mortifying
sang-froid and distance towards those who sought her notice, especially if she thought
them any way her inferiors. Margaret perceiving her a young person, much about the
same age with herself, and dressed neat and plain, and the materials of her dress far from
costly, thought her some unassuming girl, humble, perhaps, as herself in life; and she
smiled at her when she saw her look towards her: but the young lady immediately took
off her eyes, without any change in her saturnine countenance, and either applied herself
to her dinner or whispered her mother. When the ladies, about nine o'clock, withdrew to the drawing-room, Mrs.
Davenport was deeply engaged, apart, with Mrs. Benworth and her daughter. Margaret
was entirely deserted, and left to her own reflections; which so reverted back to the farm
at Eglantine, to her father, to her happy, happy sister, and poor Phelim O'Gurphy, that
with much difficulty she repressed the tears from starting to her eyes. Miss Benworth at length rose, and went up to her; asked her if she could play or
sing? and gave an audible "Oh! heavens!" when she answered in the negative. Miss Benworth then addressed Mrs. Davenport, with, "You know, I consider
myself at home here, and therefore I will go and shut myself up alone in your musicroom,
and practise the air of 'Just like Love! '"-"Do, my darling!" replied Mrs.
Davenport. Now, though the flinty-looking cold-hearted Miss Benworth would have caused
the little genial deity to have fled away in disgust, yet she affected to be in raptures at this
charming air, which she contrived to sing scientifically; but that is not the kind of singing
which can touch the heart: O divine Camoens! could thy love-fraught spirit descend to
earth, and hear thy breathings of nature and pure passion thus profaned; how wouldst thou
despise the wretched beings, who never knew in any degree the flame that animated thy
bosom, and which, felt by thee in all its ardency, at length consumed thee, and snapt the
fine chord asunder which bound thy soaring spirit to mortality! *Miss Benworth played well; but she sang the pathetic air of "Here's a health to
those far away!" without one single emotion (though she had a brother who expired in the
field of honour), and with as much ease and indifference as she would have performed a
Scotch reel or an Irish jig. After the departure of this unfeeling amateur, Mrs. Davenport threw herself on the
sofa, by Mrs. Benworth, and began a confidential conversation, in a very low voice; but
of which Margaret could make out the following sentences:



Mrs. Benworth. * Well, now, really, my dear Davenport, I cannot think what you
see in him to be so infatuated: as for me, when Mr. Benworth was living, (God rest his
soul,) if I did cast my eyes of liking on another, I always took care he should be a fine
handsome fellow. Mrs. Davenport. Oh! Benworth, you naughty creature! I declare you're too bad! La! my dear, I only like him as a dangler. Mrs. Benworth. Aye, you're a little fool, and ---- and ---- as for him
---- he ---- [Here the ladies whispered. Mrs. Davenport. Well, well, no more of that-my dear creature, he is so
fashionable, so exquisite in his taste, and says such sweet things ---- to be sure, I
grant he's not young ----
Mrs. Benworth. A shrivelled, yellow, poor-looking creature, when I saw him last,
not worth any woman giving a thought about. Mrs. Davenport. Oh! but, my love, you have not seen him since he came from the
country: he is grown fat, and he has now got quite a nice colour-Well, well-say no
more; we cannot account for these things, but I really quite love him. Mrs. Benworth. Much good may he do you! But I say, give me something more of
a man! Mrs. Davenport. For instance, the gigantic German, Captain ---, [Here
Margaret could not distinguish the name,] or the Prince's highlander! - - - - - -
- - - - - -
And now, soon Mrs. Davenport, in all the seeming flutter of sixteen, exclaimed,
"Here he comes! Oh! "His very foot has music in't,
"As he comes up the stair." A servant then opening the door, announced, to the great astonishment of
Margaret,
"SIR CHARLES SEFTON!" *Historique. *Dialogue verbatim. Man is but man, inconstant still and various;
There's no to-morrow in him like to-day:
Perhaps, the atoms floating in his brain
Make him think honestly the present hour;
The next, a crowd of base inglorious thoughts
May mount aloft. DRYDEN. ALMOST immediately after the summons he had received, repaired to the farmhouse
the son and heir of the late Mr. Marsham. Though his person was somewhat below
the middle stature, yet it was graceful and well-proportioned; and if ever countenance was
capable of inspiring interest, by its intelligence and its sweet glow of benevolence, such
did Matthew Marsham possess, in a degree the most conspicuous. The mingled emotions
of sensibility and gratitude now moistened his eyes with a tear; which he quickly wiped
away, fearful of observation, and the being accused of hypocrisy, in expressing his regret
to the memory of a father whom he had never seen since his days of infancy. "I fear, sir," said he, addressing the Reverend Edward Marsham, "that I shall make
but a very bad farmer; however, my generous father's bequest will render me independent
of my present profession, which I embraced more from necessity than choice." "But in which it is evident," said Edward, "you had great skill, for it is very
seldom so young a man should be entrusted with the charge of a regiment, which, I am
informed, you obtained* some years ago." "Yes, sir," said Matthew, "I had the honour to gain both the applause and
friendship of the medical board; but my health was so impaired by the destructive climate
I found myself obliged to quit, that I found it absolutely requisite to its preservation, to
give up my surgeoncy in the regiment, and repair to England: with what little money I
have saved, I hoped, by practising my profession in my native country, to have obtained
in a few years a comfortable independency." Some other desultory conversation then took place, and Edward was delighted
with the good sense and acquired literature of his nephew; who, after a pause, with a
sweet air of humility, advanced towards him, and respectfully took his hand.-"May I
presume, sir," said he, "on this the commencement of our acquaintance, to request a
favour of you, which, though to me it is of magnitude, can by you be easily performed: it
is, that you would never quit me; but hold the same place in this habitation, as you did
with my generous father. Oh! sir, suffer me not to find that I enter here as the illegitimate
destroyer of your rights, usurping, in a manner, the dwelling of your ancestors; as one
who chases you from your long-accustomed home, to seek another! Consider, I intreat of
you, oh! yet consider all my servants as your own: and do not make me miserable, by
refusing this humble request." *Historique. "Be assured," replied Edward, "I feel all the value of your generous proposal; but I
estimate more the intrinsic value of possessing and taking to my heart a relation like
yourself: my eldest daughter is married to a man of rank and fortune; who, on the opening
of my late brother's will, insisted that I should hereafter make his house my home; my
promise is therefore given, and I hope," added he, with a smile, "that you will people
these numerous apartments better than your father did, and that it will be no longer
"Bachelor's Hall." Though the countenance of the interesting Matthew had become rather pallid from
his long sojournment in the unhealthy climate of St. Lucia, yet now a deep crimson
mantled over it, and the ill-represt sigh which heaved his bosom, discovered the secret to
Edward, that love had already planted his arrows in the heart of his nephew. After this unlooked-for relative had been announced in the will of her uncle, and
whom, when he presented himself, no one could help loving, Mary had felt herself happy
that it was in her power to afford her revered and much-loved parent a comfortable
asylum: the instant offer of her Frederic to that effect had delighted her beyond measure,
and she even promised herself that yet better days awaited all her family than any they
had heretofore experienced: she knew how dearly her father loved her; she knew how
happy he would be when always in her society; and the ease and elegance in which she
lived in her rural residence would ensure him many comforts which he had never known
at the farm. Her sister was amply provided for: she was the proteg�e of a woman, not
only possessed of an immense fortune, but of a sweet temper and an excellent heart-she
would never, endowed with these two last valuable gifts, forsake her; of that, this
affectionate sister felt assured. It was true, she herself had experienced some change in
the temper and manners of Mr. Harrington, but that she might naturally expect; she was
not to imagine an husband would be always a lover! Thus argued the inexperienced Mary, who, though she endeavoured to be cheerful
and contented, could not make the last reflection without a tear: she tried to persuade
herself that it was only the effect of her low spirits on the recent death of her uncle Ralph;
oh! no,-they had been just highly elated by news from her favourite and happy uncle
Charles; who had described in glowing colours the success of the British arms at
Flushing: and she had rejoiced at, and blessed a protecting Providence, that this her dear
uncle was safe and unhurt, beloved and favoured by all his superior officers. Poor Mary! she banished the thought from her mind, that her Frederic was not the same as formerly,
yet it would intrude, and it would bring the little crystal trembler to her eye. She endeavoured to drive it away with the thoughts of her sister's promised
happiness; but her sister was neither happy nor safe under Mrs. Davenport's protection;
who, though she took her as her own, did not mean to leave her a shilling! such an idea
had never entered her head. Mrs. Davenport had often that much-abused epithet bestowed upon her, of
possessing an excellent heart; but it was in her neither the seat of feeling or affection, and
her mind, if mind she had any, was swayed only by the dictates of fashion, or the customs
and opinions of those higher in rank than herself. But this Mary knew not, and in the contemplation of her sister's good fortune, her
thoughts again reverted to her father, and she cheerfully tripped up stairs to the


apartments allotted to him; and her filial affection, aided by her natural taste, embellished
his dressing-room with various articles and devices of modern elegance. Frederic Harrington began, already, to pant for change; the fatal accident that had
happened, the close mourning of his wife, and her near affinity to the deceased, would
render it quite contrary to the rules of established etiquette, for her to make her public
appearance for two or three months at least: what a delightful opportunity for him to take
an unrestrained swing of fashionable pleasure! It is true he was in deep mourning also,
but the late Mr. Marsham was only allied to him by marriage: he could very well urge that
change of air and scene was absolutely requisite to the recovery of his health: he meant
therefore to be very attentive and polite to the present owner of Eglantine farm; whose
medical skill was much thought of, and to whom Frederic meant to impart the idea of
how very much he felt the want of a more salubrious air. The morning of that day, in which Mr. Marsham meant to take up his abode at Mr.
Harrington's cottage orn�e, he walked out with his nephew, to whom he began to feel
himself very much attached, to pay a few morning visits: Edward, to return those of kind
condolence he had received from his neighbours, and a few others of ceremony, to
introduce Mr. Matthew Marsham to their notice. Lady Wringham had sent a verbal message, by her servant, on the news of Mr.
Ralph Marsham's sudden death, with her offers of sarvice to the family. Mr. Marsham therefore called at Sir John's, but heard the voice of her ladyship at
the top of the stairs, saying, "Not at home, I told you, blockhead! (addressing the servant,
who had previously told the Curate his lady was at home); and, as she retreated to her
dressing-room, they plainly heard her utter something about, "Such a clargyman indeed! encouraging his brother's bastards!" They then hastened to the cottage of that charming old lady, Mrs. Susanna
Bradbury, and were by her and her lovely niece greeted with unfeigned politeness and
cordiality; but it needed but a very small portion of penetration to discover that it was not
the first interview between Matthew Marsham and Lucy Ringwood. Elated and happy, Matthew accompanied his uncle home; but as they walked
along, seldom answered him to the purpose, except it was to acquiesce in Mrs. Susan
Bradbury's being the most delightful old woman ever seen; though it was plain enough to
perceive, that not the old woman, but the young one was the object of Matthew's
attention; for towards Mrs. Susan he had scarcely ever looked during the whole of their
visit, and no one ever found themselves able to make a short one to Mrs. Susanna. The poor faithful Irish servant, Phelim O'Gurphy, could not endure the sight of
this misbegotten intruder, as he called him, at the farm; and took care always to be out of
the way, if Mr. Matthew Marsham wanted his services. Edward was surprised on this day
of his intended departure for his daughter's cottage, to see the poor fellow enter his
chamber, crying and sobbing, as if his heart would break; "Och!" said he, "and is poor
Phelim come to see this day? When the brother of my late dear master, and the same
mother's son with himself, should go out of his own lawful dwelling, to make room for
an unlawful child! and perhaps his mother might be no better than old Peg Plunkett of
Dublin." "If you wish to preserve my favour and friendship," said Edward, gravely, "I insist
upon it, that I never hear you utter a word of disrespect against the mother of that


excellent young man, who I am sure will make one of the kindest of masters to you all,
while you behave well."-"Och! but I am sure," said Phelim, "and he'll never be my
master. "-"Know when you are well off," said Edward, "and do not, be a ridiculous folly,
and misplaced zeal towards me, throw yourself out of a situation, in which I am certain
you will be truly comfortable. "-"No, no, sir, there is no comfort left for poor Phelim,
unless you consent to keep him for your own servant." "That is impossible, my good lad, I never, since I have been in my brother's
house, kept a servant of my own; and I am sure I shall not now."-"Och! sir," urged the
yet weeping O'Gurphy, "I want no wages, I have saved a little bit of money since I lived
with your own dear brother,-I want nothing of you, but for the love of J--s, sir, pray
let me go with you. I cannot, I cannot stay about the farm when you have left it." "But, my good fellow," said Edward, much affected, "I cannot take you to Mr.
Harrington's, their house is full of servants; and what would my son and daughter think,
if I, who will want, in their establishment, for no attention, of any kind whatever, should
be so whimsical as to incumber them with my own servant?" "Sir," said the persevering Phelim, "will your honour give me leave to spake one
word to Mr. Harrington alone, by mine own self? "-"By no means, you will for ever
offend me, if you do; make yourself easy and contented: your present master will soon
render you so, if it is not your own fault. "-"The devil set fire to me, if ever he shall be a
master of mine! "-"Fie on you, Phelim," said Edward, scarce able to keep his
countenance, "let me hear no swearing, of any kind;" but finding his son-in-law was
below, he hastened down stairs. Phelim followed, and almost began the renowned howl
of his country, crying out, "Och, and can you be after leaving me, now? "-"What is the
matter, my dear sir," said Harrington, "are you inflicting corporeal as well as spiritual
chastisement on your servant? "-"No, neither," said Edward, "but I cannot get rid of him;
I believe he will throw me down stairs:" for Phelim had fastened himself to the skirts of
Mr. Marsham's coat; who was at length compelled to explain this ludicrous scene to Mr.
Harrington, whose heart, naturally good, ever alive to, and actuated by good-nature, and
ever ready to appreciate the genuine feelings of honesty and attachment, insisted that the
faithful Hibernian should be retained at the cottage as the Reverend Mr. Marsham's
servant. The affliction of Phelim was now succeeded by joy as tumultuous as it was
unfeigned: and so often did he quaff the nectarous fluid of strong, home-brewed ale, to
the health of his master, and the long-life and happiness of the noble Mr. Harrington and
his beautiful lady, that Phelim, when he accompanied the Reverend Edward Marsham to
the cottage, was completely intoxicated. As he followed his master along a very wide path-way, which, however, was not
sufficiently wide, for the space he took, by his frequent reeling from one side to the other,
they met, as they walked in this guise, Sir John and Lady Wringham taking an evening
walk. "I declare," said she, as loud as she could, "if there isn't some parsons who
desarves to have their gowns stripped over their ears; first they encourages filthy
bastardy, and next drunkenness: do but look at that nasty, Irish fellow, as drunk as a sow;
and I dare say the master is not much better." Edward heard her, in all the silence of contempt; for he was happy to find that his
attendant, brimful of joy, as well as of liquor, was too absorbed in the reveries, which the


delightful accomplishment of his wishes had suffered to float in his muddled brain; else,
no doubt, but the "sprig, of shilleghlah," which he grasped, would, in his present
maddened state of mind, had he heard her ladyship, been applied to the little support, on
which she leaned her weighty arm; in spite of his baronetage, or all the boasted wealth
and honours of the past, present, and future race of the Wringhams. Edward knew that all lectureship, in the present state of his servant, would be not
only useless, but misunderstood; he therefore requested his son-in-law to order his servant
to put him to bed, and reserved his own wise and mild exhortations till the morrow. In a few days, Mr. Harrington became extremely intimate with the late Mr.
Marsham's acknowledged son: his views, it is true, at first, were somewhat selfish, as he
wished to render Matthew his vehicle, to obtain an emancipation, for a short period, from
the fetters of matrimonial sameness! But never did Frederic feel more gratification, than in his acquaintance with this
amiable young man: how unlike the tumultuous and momentary friendship he had formed
with the Leslies? and yet Harrington, though a virtuous esteem seemed taking firm root in
his bosom for one possessed of sense, manly refinement, with excellence of heart and
understanding; and though the wavering Frederic was in full and undisputed possession
of all the warm and uncontaminated affection of a virtuous mind, enshrined in a form the
most captivating and lovely; yet, ah! that form, which he pressed to his bosom, the
virtues, the attractions he daily and hourly witnessed, were, alas! only those of A WIFE! His newly-acquired and much-esteemed friend was a country neighbour, who
resided very near to him, and whom he could see at all times; so he could the wife of his
fondest choice, and the reverend parent whom he loved and honoured: the sigh of
discontent then often escaped him, and wafted with it, his wishes for the pleasures of the
gay world; and he languished to take his accustomed round in the scenes of fashionable
dissipation. Oh! how little prized are pure and tranquil pleasures, by the high-born and
thoughtless votaries of wealth and splendour! Oh! wayward man, how eager art thou to
rush on to thine own ruin, and to implant in thy breast the bitter, lasting, but unavailing
thorns of remorse! Frederic Harrington took care not to say the true cause of his wishing for a change
of scene; but told Mr. Matthew Marsham that he had been always so accustomed to
autumnal sea-bathings, at the different watering-places, that he really felt this custom had
become an absolute requisite towards the preservation of his health. Matthew could urge
nothing against what appeared so reasonable and what he had always found, in the course
of his profession, extremely sanative: he therefore readily acquiesced. Mary expected that her Frederic would have been solicitous of her accompanying
him; but she soon found her mistake, by his telling her he should be only absent for a very
short period; and that he was happy to leave her father with her, to alleviate and shorten
her hours of solitude; that, by the time he returned, she would have enlivened the deep
gloom of her sables, and they would then make their appearance in London. Mary heard
in silence, and but ill-represt her tears; her bosom heaved with the agitation of stifled
sorrow, and her cheek turned pale: for as Mr. Harrington had fixed on Cromer, in
Norfolk, for his bathing-place, she thought, although it had become, in some degree, a
fashionable resort, yet it might be made, to those who wished it to be so, a very retired


residence; and her sables had only furnished an excuse for her husband to depart without
her.
