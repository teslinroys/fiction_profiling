I call on thee! Where would have been the ray
of light, which illumined thy pen, if Sentiment had been unknown to thee? Was not the
affection of Werter the offspring of Sentiment alone? Was it not the refinement of
passion, acting on the soul of sensibility? Oh! immortal and beatified lover of Charlotte! how often have I melted over your virtues, your passion, and your melancholy fate!-
How often have I contemplated on the soul-harrowing picture of thy death!-How often
in imagination descended with thee to the tomb! "Sterne, too, thou genius of Sentiment, thou friend of all created beings, was it not
Sentiment which warmed thy heart, when the oath of Uncle Toby blotted thy immortal
page? And is it not to Sentiment, to Sentiment alone, that we owe the life of our souls, the
most precious of our existing moments. "For me, for Clarissa, she avows it," (and she gracefully extended her right hand,
and then pressed it emphatically on her breast.) "Clarissa glories in the avowal, that when
she ceases to be actuated by Sentiment, she ceases to think herself a reasonable being!" The different sentiments of the company, during this wild rhapsody of Miss
Moreton, as expressed by their gestures and countenances, were worthy of observation. The brows of Mrs. Deborah Moreton were curved into a tremendous frown. She moved to
and fro in her chair, as if she had lost all patience; and when Clarissa had finished, she
said, "The Lord be good unto me! Miss Moreton, all the world must think you have lost
your reason now!" The Chevalier had placed himself very near Miss Moreton, in an
attitude expressive of "wrapt attention;" while, as if catching the very impulse by which
she was directed, his whole countenance marked that he, too, was the devoted worshipper
of Sentiment. Walwyn stood in the door-way of the Lyceum, the living statue of stage-struck
astonishment; and as the last fall of Clarissa's voice struck on his charmed ear, he
clasped his hands together, saying, "Is she not more than painting can express, or youthful
poets fancy when they love?" "Oh no, by no means, by no means," said Copy; "I have
taken her, I have taken her several times myself, and I think I might succeed again. Miss

Moreton's eye and figure are just the thing!" "Miss Moreton's be very fine tones of voice,
don't you think so, Signora?" asked Monsieur. "They be so fine, so silvery sweet!" "Oh, yes," said the Signora, yawning; "and they take in such compass-and her
action is so tragic!" Mary Cuthbert looked at her cousin with wonder, fear, and pity; and
her features expressed all she felt. Convulsed by laughter, Montgomery could not repress his risible feelings, till,
turning his head towards that part of the room where she sat, he observed her sorrowful
air, and, at one view, entered into her thoughts. Then, the most bitter look of severity was
to be seen on his countenance, as he turned towards Germ; who, as usual, with spectacles
on nose, was poring over a large heap of books, and had continued his studies during the
whole effusion of sentiment, with perfect composure:
"Did you ever trouble yourself, Sir, to examine the history of the Queen Bee? It is
a study well worthy your attention, I assure you," said Germ. "I have," said Montgomery,
with some asperity of voice, "and have vainly endeavoured to find out the character of the
drones, who attended her; for I find she is always followed by a swarm of them." "They
are useless insects, Sir," said Germ-"Intirely so," said Montgomery, "and I admire the
discernment which enables the Queen Bee to discover this, and expel them from her
society!" Mrs. Deborah Moreton soon walked off; little notice was taken of her departure;
indeed she paid no parting compliments to any of the company, except a "well-God
bless you!" to her niece, a nod to Mary Cuthbert; and a formal curtesy, and, "I wish you
good night, Sir," to Montgomery, as he opened the door of the Lyceum to let her pass. In all the wild wanderings of Clarissa Moreton, her heart had hitherto taken no
part. Borne away by vanity and self-confidence, she fancied that every new eccentricity,
into which she ran, was a new proof of discernment, of talent, and of pre-eminent merit;
or rendered her more interesting, and more graceful, in the eyes of her beholders. She
liked the attention of the men, and welcomed the fulsome adulation of every coxcomb
(whom she chose y'clep a genius) as a natural homage; but she had hitherto felt no
particular preference in favour of any individual; and, though her fortune was daily
suffering from the crowd of worthless beings, whom she drew around her, yet she never
appeared likely to become the exclusive prey of one, frequently declaring, that she would
not resign her liberty for the best husband in Christendom. While these strange and volatile opinions deterred the regular and the wellprincipled
from pursuing her, it rather emboldened than intimidated those of a contrary
stamp; those who were acquainted with the instability and the capriciousness, of the
female character, and those who, having nothing to lose, would make a bold venture in
pursuit of fortune. Amongst these were Walwyn and the Chevalier. Walwyn had seen enough of the frailty of the ladies, to know that he had great
advantages on his side. The musty studies of the antiquated Germ were not calculated to
warm the imagination, any more than the frivolous Monsieur, or the absent Copy were to
interest it. His own pursuits gave him a decided advantage over them. There was so much to
be expected from the scenes and the situations of the drama, and he had there the greatest
opportunities of prosecuting his suit with all the enthusiasm of passion:-that passion
was there depicted in words the most forcible, tender, and yet warmly coloured. Miss

Moreton herself, by turns the soft Monimia; the interesting Belvidera, hanging with fond
affection on her Jassier; the voluptuous Cleopatra; the frail Calista, mourning her fault!-
Surely he had every thing to hope, if Clarissa's heart had but the smallest preference in
his favour. And this he would have suspected, if he had not perceived, that the sighing,
the sentimental Chevalier D'Aubert, was admitted to all these liberties in propri�
person�, which he had never attempted, but as the hero of the tragic tale. The Chevalier was artful and designing. Under the semblance of misfortune and
distress, he hoped to bend Miss Moreton's principles to his own base purposes. A needy
adventurer, he had already taken advantage of the distresses of his own country, to be
received and commiserated in this; and he had left his wife to earn a precarious
subsistence in London; by making flowers, and by other ingenious little devices, whilst he
tried to work on the feelings of Miss Moreton, by representing himself as the most
wretched of all created beings; as wedded to a woman without a soul, without an existing
sentiment; and, by poisoning Clarissa's ear with the impure and sophistical tenets of the
French school of philosophers, and by putting their productions into her hands, he
endeavoured to weaken her small deference for established laws and for revealed religion. But, while Clarissa was enraptured with the insinuating manners of the Chevalier,
and her fancy was taken captive by the flowery style, and the specious arguments of his
favourite authors; she did not conceive the idea of forming any connection with him, but
that of the most unlimited friendship. Indeed, neither the form or the face of the
Chevalier, were calculated to kindle another flame, in the breast of a young lady who
made any use of her eyes in her choice of a partner for her heart; the one not being
moulded in the harmony of proportion, and the other being deficient both in hue and
comeliness. But a Frenchman, it is universally known, has a good opinion of himself; and the
little Chevalier would not have yielded the palm of manly beauty to the Apollo Belvedere,
although he had an air of negligence and of melancholy abstraction, which appeared
wholly unconscious of his attractions. Yet while he feared Walwyn, and Walwyn feared and hated him, there was now a
third, more to be dreaded by each, and on whom neither of them had yet cast a thought;
and this was Montgomery! Montgomery had come to the Villa at the entreaty of Walwyn; who, knowing that
he could not fail of being amused, and being fully aware that the principles of
Montgomery would secure him from being his rival (as they were in direct opposition to
those of Miss Moreton) he thought he should be adding to the gaiety of the Villa by this
addition to the party. But here he was mistaken. Montgomery had never felt himself so reserved-so
silent-so inclined to be petulant, as since his introduction to the Villa. He looked at Miss
Moreton with something very little short of horror. He had the highest opinion of the
female character; and any defalcation from the standard raised in his own mind, gave him
a disagreeable sensation. But Miss Moreton's conduct was most unusually opposite to
any thing he had ever seen or formed an idea of. The imposing air of conscious superiority, which was apparent in her demeanour,
at the moment when she was rising to the very acm� of folly and indiscretion, filled him
with disgust; and his feelings were more strong, because his pity was excited, in no

common degree, for the interesting Mary Cuthbert. And though, as a cool spectator at the
Attic Villa, Montgomery might have been entertained, and contributed in his turn to
amuse; though his lively gallantry, and ready wit, might have delighted the mistress of the
mansion, and his sarcastic humour would have given an edge to the gaiety of his friend
Walwyn; yet these were all lost to him, in contemplating the peculiar situation of the
young orphan; whose modest sweetness of manners, and the bewitching naivett� of
whose countenance, could not be contemplated by him without the utmost melancholy
and regret. Indeed, so forcible was the impression made on his mind, that to be again at
ease, he would have flown from the Villa almost as soon as he had entered it, if he could
have resolved to quit that lovely object for whom he felt so much. To a serious mind, such as Montgomery possessed, one in whom education and
situation had both encouraged habits of reasoning and reflection, there were a thousand
dangers to be apprehended for Mary Cuthbert. She seemed, indeed, to fear them for
herself; but with the helpless apprehension of an infant, who yields itself an affrighted
victim to the devastating flames. Yet how to warn-to caution-to save her! Alas! Montgomery could only pity, in
silence pity her! He had no friends, no connections, who could put out their fostering
arms to this poor girl. His parents were compassionate and humane; their tender hearts
would ache to hear of the distress which they had not the means of alleviating; for,
struggling with a narrow income, and a numerous family, they were but just removed
from a state of poverty. How, then, could they extend their protection to her? Such also was the strict import of Mr. Cuthbert's will in this respect; and so
entire, so implicit a deference did his daughter pay to it, that he questioned if any
inducement would prevail on Miss Cuthbert to quit her cousin till she became of age. Three years of trial! thought Montgomery; oh! if Mary Cuthbert passes through this
frightful ordeal, her manners unsophisticated, her morals pure, she will be pre-eminent in
merit as now in loveliness!-but the heavy sigh which concluded this mental soliloquy,
seemed to proclaim, that the wish could never be realized. "Now while the drowsy is lost in sleep." THOMSON. MISS Moreton saw that she had a new guest in Mr. Montgomery. In Walwyn's friend she
had expected to behold the prototype of himself; one who could rattle, rant, spout, rave,
and sigh, and laugh in a breath, and be just what the humour of the moment should
require. How, then, was she surprised at seeing that she must condescend to talk to him, if
she would hear his voice; how was she astonished at seeing him retire to a distance,
whenever an opportunity offered of approaching her; and sit in sombre silence during
those bright effusions of humour, which set her "table in a roar!" This peculiarity of behaviour, rendered him at first an object of no common
curiosity, which was heightened, perhaps, at perceiving that his dark eyes beamed with
intelligence; and that, whatever might be the cause of his taciturnity, she could not for a
moment impute it to a "deficiency of soul." "Perhaps," thought Clarissa, "dazzled with the emanations of my superior genius,
he fears to approach me, lest the refulgent scintillations of my wit should be too much for
his faculties. Perhaps he too painfully remembers the different situations in which we are
placed by the world. He may be awed by the customs of society; he may not rightly
estimate my notions of mental equality, which contemn all customs that would place
barriers to sentiment and genius!" So reflected Clarissa on her pillow; while the animated countenance, the fine form
of Montgomery, as he had leaned over Germ, when she concluded her invocation to
Sentiment, danced before her eyes; for, though she had not heard a syllable that he
uttered, yet, from the warmth of his manner, and the bright sparkle of his eye, she was
sure that an eulogium on herself must, at that moment, have involuntarily escaped him;
and, surely, at such a moment, he must have been more than mortal to have restrained it! "Such a character," thought Clarissa, pursuing her ruminations, "wants
encouraging and emboldening. I must draw him out; Montgomery's is the extreme of
sentimentality. Enthusiast as I am for Sentiment, I like to hear her votaries talk of her. Oh! if the words of the Chevalier were poured from the lips of Montgomery, I should
then have an opportunity of regaling my eyes and ears with harmony! D'Aubert is refined
and tender, but his person is against him. Walwyn has fire and vivacity, but he is too
energetic-too fervent." Miss Moreton sighed-It was seldom that she sighed, except whilst hearing the
Chevalier read, Walwyn recite, or to fill a pause in one of her rhapsodical effusions. Perhaps this was the most deep drawn sigh, which had escaped her for some time; and
she rocked her wild brain on the pillow, while forming numerous plans for drawing out
this kindred soul! On Mary Cuthbert she did not bestow a moment's consideration; for she had
perceived, at the first view, that she was quite of the common stamp; a good sort of yea
and nay girl, who seemed to suit aunt Deborah, but who had most unblushingly avowed
her entire ignorance of the French language: "le pauvre Chevalier had quite laughed when
she had told him of it; and D'Aubert seldom laughed!" That a girl who said little, and that little in a diffident manner; who used no
action, and was quite deficient in attitudes and energies; that such a girl could ever rival
Miss Moreton in the favour of any individual, was quite out of her calculation. She
allowed that Mary Cuthbert had a pretty childish face; but she was quite under size, and
had not the least grace or dignity. A variety of sensations accompanied Mary Cuthbert to her chamber; none of them
of the most pleasing cast. The moon shone with mild lustre into the window; and, folding
her arms, she stood before it. She surveyed the beautifully wooded park by this softened
light; and a sigh issued from her bosom at the contrast, which the quiet and peaceful
scene from without displayed to the interior of the Villa. How happy, thought she, might my cousin be in this elegant retirement, if she
would but resolve to perform the duties allotted to her station; and be contented to be
esteemed and beloved! Of how much use would that fortune be, which is now wasted on
the profligate and designing? Alas! she little imagines, that she is ridiculed and despised
by those very beings, who now crowd around her, and pour their nauseous flattery in her
ear! Mary Cuthbert lifted up her heart to Heaven with meek resignation. She
acquiesced in all its dispensations. She acknowledged, tearfully acknowledged, that she
had enjoyed many years of undisturbed happiness; and that it was her part to meet her
present difficulties with unrepining patience. She was walking in the path prescribed to
her by her father. "Then why," sighed she, "do I fear any evil, for thou, O God, art with
me: thy rod and thy staff comfort me?"
