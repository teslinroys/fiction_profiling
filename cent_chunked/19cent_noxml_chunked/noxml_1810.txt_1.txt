when shall thy
Margaritta be hailed as thy happy bride, and addressed by the title of her grace, as she
shares with thee the ducal coronet? Alas! the clouds of fate intervene, and at present
obscure our future destiny; one brutal uncle, a rigid father, and a rustic sister, all combine
to persecute the wretched Margaritta!" Edward, who had only walked a good pace, now reached his daughter, and thinking
that she prest the discoloured linen to her eyes only to dry the effusions of a benevolent
and too sensible heart, gave her a tender paternal pressure to his bosom, and put half-acrown
into her hand for the purchase of a new ribbon to her bonnet, to replace that which
the rain had much injured. Mary, the eldest of the Reverend Mr. Marsham's daughters, was called by every one
round about and in the village a very pretty girl; yet, take every feature separately, and
they would not be called beautiful: the glow of health and sprightly innocence, in a
female of nineteen, seldom fails to attract; but Mary had to boast of more; a sweetness,
mingled with a playful archness, embellished her countenance, and while they rendered
its charms indescribable, made them also irresistible: her eyes, in regard to colour, had no
claim to beauty, for they were only a dark grey; but they were lively and sparkling, and
received additional attraction from a long, dark eye-lash: her nose was neither Roman nor
Grecian; but it was well formed, and no other would have suited her other features so
well, perhaps it might be Egyptian, as that is the present fashion of the day; though we
have not yet heard of any standard for that prominent part of the face, over which the
snaky ornament of Isis, after having twisted its folds amongst the lovely tresses of
Britannia's fair, sits formidably nodding and darting its forked tongue, to the dismay of
those who would dare approach the medusan ornament. The mouth of Mary vied in colour with the ripe cherry, and her teeth might come in
competition with ivory: her form was not sylph-like, but it was tall, upright, and of a
plumpness approaching to embonpoint: her voice was so melodious, and her ear so
perfectly correct, that her uncle Ralph often wished to yield to the temptation of having
her taught to perform (not on the harp) but on the piano-forte; but as all the brothers
judged that it would be only an ornamental part of education, which she would in her
present and future sphere of life never have occasion to display, they contented
themselves with the delightful warblings of her wild notes, with which she often charmed
their hours of rural leisure. Margaret, or as we shall sometimes have occasion to call her, Margaritta, was one
year younger than her sister; her stature might rather be called short than tall, and not very
well proportioned; for her shoulders were exceeding broad, which defect she always
dignified by saying she had the true cleopatra back: her countenance had some meaning,
and would not have been disagreeable, though far from pretty, had she not distorted and


twisted every feature, in order to give to it that expression which she judged was
irresistible: her large dark eyes would have been called good, had she not been
continually casting them upwards, in a solemn, rolling kind of appeal to heaven: her
forehead was much seamed by the small-pox; the rest of her face had pretty well escaped
that rueful malady; and her small rosy mouth resembled that of her sister, only with this
difference; Mary looked best when she spoke or smiled, Margaret looked best with her
mouth close shut; for having one evening, in a romantic reverie, mistaken the hard claw
of a fine rock lobster for the fish itself, in her attempts to masticate it she unfortunately
broke two of her front teeth, which gave her rather an unpleasant appearance whenever
she attempted to "sweetly smile." These defects in her person, her health being not very good, and her nerves weak, and
as her mother had, in giving her life, lost her own, made the excellent Edward peculiarly
careful of shewing that partiality which he certainly could not avoid feeling for her elder
sister. He had indulged Margaret, on account of a long confinement from illness, with the
perusal of those novels a neighbouring circulating library afforded; a subscription to
which was afterwards continued by good-natured Ralph for his two nieces' amusement. The effects of this reading, on a mind easily softened and naturally weak, is already
perceptible to the reader in the character of Margaret. Mary read only to amuse an hour,
and never suffered it to interfere with her more useful occupations; yet she was fond of
literature; and her uncle Charles, with whom she was a decided favourite, had presented
her with a small and elegant library, from the best approved writers for female
improvement. Margaret, in spite of all her father's indulgent kindness, imagined herself as one
languishing under a severe parent's cruel rigidity; while her benefactor, her kind uncle
Ralph, she looked upon as little better than a mere brute; toward her uncle Charles she
wavered in her affections, and this wavering was, in some degree, mutual: in those
intervals, which, it must be said, happened but seldom, when Margaret, by an imaginary
new conquest, quitted her reading for the ornamenting of her person, and tried to make
herself pleasant and agreeable, uncle Charles began to admire his niece Margaret, and
really loved her for her truly compassionate nature; has been in those moments drawn in
to talk sentiment with her, accompany her in her walks to some of the neighbouring
cottages, (for Margaret knew all the heroines of romance did the same); and there Charles
would drop a tear, with the ready shilling to the wants of indigence: then her uncle
Charles was the only soul in the family congenial to her own, then he was extolled to the
skies: the next day has thrown all this romantic edifice to the ground; for this beloved
uncle is made the confident of some ridiculous love-affair, or is condemned to hear her
read through two or three pages of absurdity and inconsistency; he then becomes too
much disgusted to contain his irritable temper, and he makes use of the same language to
his delicate and persecuted niece (according to her account) as he would to a private
soldier: Oh! she detests the very sight of uncle Charles, a man of blood, fit only to wade
through fields of slaughter, or reside in a camp; while duty, inflexible duty obliges her to
love her father, on whose grave countenance she seldom beholds a smile; oh! what would
she not give could she but see a smile on that countenance beaming upon her! but alas! a


parent's wrath hangs over her head, she says, and she is the most miserable of created
beings. The heroine of a romance, she knows, was never happy, therefore she will yet look
forward with hope to the winding up of her adventures, after she has experienced several
additional and aggravated sorrows; till she has explored dark unfathomable caverns and
dungeons, or has been confined in some high and moss-grown tower, through whose
subterraneous passages her lover will enter, wind up the ruined staircase which leads to
her horrible prison, from whence he will deliver her, and boldly present her to his stern
and noble father, who will melt with love and paternal tenderness on the discovery of her
heroic and intrinsic virtue. The heart of the lively Mary, though susceptible, was yet her own; she superintended
with alacrity and good humour the household affairs of her uncle; nor was she deficient in
spinning, or any of those housewifely employments which would render her an useful
farmer's wife; but she could unite gentility and industry, good sense and trifling, so
happily, that all who saw, admired her, and all who knew her loved and esteemed her. Margaret was very often in love; though at present there was one who was peculiarly
the object of her notice: this was a young man who had come the preceding summer to
make hay for her uncle, with some other itinerant labourers from Ireland: the lad had
neither father nor mother; was as honest and industrious as he was poor, and gave fair
promise of being an excellent under-servant; he could neither write nor read: but Ralph,
who cared very little about the erudition of a servant, and indeed would often express his
disapprobation of Sunday Schools, which only served, he used to say, to spoil those
whose lot must be only to labour, and that we had much better servants before they were
established; we believe he rather therefore preferred the ignorance of Phelim O'Gurphy,
the abovementioned lad; and wanting a servant to go on errands, and occasionally work
on the farm, took the Hibernian, to his great joy, to live with him in that capacity: but as
Phelim cast his eyes towards the young ladies who were seated in the parlour, when he
was called in to receive the welcome intelligence, Margaret immediately discovered
homage, love, and reverence, in the eyes of the enamoured youth! Severely did she take
herself to task for not instantly acquainting her father and uncles with his temerity in
daring to aspire to her beauty; and she resolved to watch every opportunity of exercising
her vengeance on the unfortunate and truly unconscious Phelim, till one day an incident
occurred which convinced her that he could be no other than a nobleman in disguise! His complexion, like that of many of his countrymen, was extremely fair, and though
his face was burnt by the sun, his arms and bosom were white as those of the fairest
female; otherwise his personal attractions were by no means conspicuous; for his figure
was short and clumsy, his face broad and vacant, and his hair of a fiery red; which
furnished Margaret with the idea of "Hyperion's curls," and ringlets of gold! One sultry day, as she strolled in search of adventures over her uncle's meadows, she
discovered, reposing at his full length, Phelim O'Gurphy; though it could not literally be
called repose, as he appeared to be much agitated by some terrific dream; and as
Irishmen, either waking or sleeping, are very apt to utter all their thoughts, the following
words escaped him, in the true brogue, and all the native energy of his country: "Oh! help,
holy mother of St. Patrick! Arrah! now, where is the good Duke of Tyrconnel?" Margaret, who was utterly ignorant of the Irish peerage; and what titles were or were
not extinct, as she gazed on the snowy whiteness of his wrist and throat, was now fully
convinced that he was certainly the Duke of Tyrconnel in disguise! and that the holy
mother of St. Patrick meant no other than the noble dame to whom he (no doubt a Knight
of St. Patrick) owed his splendid birth; this noble mother was instantly created, from his
calling her holy, by the prolific brain of Margaret, into the abbess of a nunnery; and it was
most probable she reasoned with herself that she had been canonized by the Pope for a
saint! From that moment her whole thoughts became fixed on the high conquest she was
convinced she had achieved over the heart of this noble and most accomplished youth. O fashion! now a goddess, now a friend,
At whose levee, pride, folly, vice attend;
Thy vot'ries are of ev'ry rank and age;
All play the part of fool on fashion's stage. THE AUTHOR. THE letter which the Reverend Mr. Marsham had received, contained a few lines
informing him the Right Honorable incumbent was coming to pass six weeks at his
living; and as his retinue, composing his family and tonish friends, were weary of the
watering-place they had just been honouring with their company, were to come with him,
he had favored his curate with the commission of ordering the house-keeper at the
spacious parsonage-house to have the beds well-aired, and every thing in order to receive
her master, his lady, and her sister; with three gentlemen of rank and fortune, together
with an humble female friend. The first of these gentlemen, Sir Charles Sefton, a wealthy baronet, was the avowed
suitor of Lady Isabella Emerson, sister to Lady Caroline Leslie, the Rector's lady: the
second was a young gentleman lately come to a very large estate, a Mr. Harrington, whom
Lady Caroline, devoted to play, was endeavouring to pidgeon, till she plucked him bare,
and he might then give place to some other who should be more full in feather. At
present, the money of Mr. Harrington, always readily lent, was very useful to the
Honorable and Reverend Mr. Leslie, whose paternal inheritance, and the annual income
of two very rich benefices, had been much exhausted to supply the unbounded
extravagance of himself and his lady. The third gentleman was Sir Edward Harrington, who had come down into the
country, not from his love for the society of those he had accompanied, but merely to
watch over and guard the oft-times thoughtless conduct of a nephew whom he loved as
his own child. The humble friend was a Mrs. Kennedy, the widow of an Irish fortune-hunter, who,
after having spent an ample fortune which the lady had generously given him the sole
disposal of when she gave him her hand, as she was verging towards the decline of life,
left her with only her talents to support her, in that precarious, little-to-be envied
occupation of an authoress! *
By adulatory dedications to the great, her own respectable family, rare abilities, and
quickness in composing her little works, she had ensured their patronage, and often made
one in their country excursions: she was particularly welcome to the Lady Isabella, whose
dearest delight consisted in quizzing, and who, in Mrs. Kennedy, found a continual butt. Though Mrs. Kennedy was possessed of unusual talents, yet there was an obscurity
in the expression of her thoughts which often puzzled the reader, and made him wonder
where he was: to indulge a pretty and flowery expression, she would sacrifice all sense,
*Historique. and substitute for it inexplicable absurdity: to pourtray the "wings of pity," or the humid
drop of compassion, she has, in the confined metre of poetry, rendered her meaning
wholly unintelligible. Her general conduct was rather of the artful kind; and she knew well how to preserve
her rich and titled friends; and thus never wanted an elegant home or costly presents. The Right Honorable Rector's character will be easily discovered by his conversation
and conduct; he was far from being a credit to his sacred profession; and often did he
execrate the hour which made him wear the cloth: the conduct of his wife, or the example
she set, were totally indifferent to him; though he was too polite ever to treat her ill, or
deny her one of the many and exorbitant claims she laid on his purse, while there
remained in it any thing to give her. *
Lady Caroline Leslie was the very life of fashion, and gave in to every species of
tonish dissipation; but gambling was her prevailing fault: she would have been handsome,
had not the continual vigils of deep play rendered her complexion too sallow, and her
eyes too hollow for any art to restore to their native hue and lustre: she was not averse to
gallantry, and so ready to assist it in another, that she has even facilitated the elopement
of a sister from her husband, that she might fly to the arms of another married lover! *
But the devotion of Lady Caroline to the gaming-table had hitherto prevented her
from taking any part herself in the annals of indiscretion, vulgarly called crim. con. Lady Isabella Emerson was like her sister, a great votary of fashion, but detested
play, except that kind of play which a love of satire afforded her; and which the modern
quiz and daily hoax were calculated to give to her mischievous abilities. Like Margaritta, she was very fond of modern publications, but her studies were of a
different kind, and all consisted of false systems: the deluding sophistry of some freethinking
German authors, with whose language she was well acquainted, and whose
dangerous and delusive principles she imbibed; from whose fascinating descriptions she
found vice stripped of its hideous appearance, and wearing an angel's form; while for her
lighter reading she perused the loose sentiments contained in the French novels of
Faublas; Le Fils naturel, and all the dangerous works of Diderot, and other revolutionary
writers. The effects of such studies on a mind like that of Lady Isabella's may well be
conceived; marriage she held in utter contempt, openly expatiated on the folly of all the
outward ceremonies of religion, and was a very pretty female atheist. *
These principles her reverend brother-in-law never took any pains to correct,
alleging, that perhaps she was right, as far as any thing he knew to the contrary! Sir Charles Sefton, her admirer, who was turned of forty, and owned to three and
thirty, took all possible pains to conceal his real age from the quick eyes of his shrewd
and penetrating mistress: he had been so much the martyr to the various vices of fashion,
that he looked more than fifty-five; but his family and connexions were all noble, himself
immensely rich, and he was therefore looked upon by the friends of Lady Isabella as a
most desirable match; and her youth, beauty, and vivacity, made this whimsical beau
imagine himself to be deeply in love: he really idolized her for her love of ridicule, so
prevalent in his own nature; and pictured to himself the happy hours they should pass
*Historique. *To our modern female reformist, Mary Woolstonecroft, and her husband, she was indebted for these latter
sentiments, so uncongenial with our "national prejudices," as she chose to call them. together, in mutually laughing at the whole circle of their friends and acquaintance; while
his consummate vanity would not suffer him to see, that he chiefly was the decided mark
at which Lady Isabella pointed the most envenomed arrows of her sarcastic wit. Sir Edward Harrington was a worthy baronet, who had been some years a widower,
was at present childless, but had adopted his nephew, Mr. Harrington, as his heir,
provided the tenor of his conduct was such as this excellent uncle could approve;
otherwise, well and dearly though he loved him, as he knew he was already rich enough,
without his assistance, he should leave his own large fortune to better hands. Sir Edward's character was of a peculiar kind, in this our day: he was the friend of
every worthy man! to such, however ungifted by birth, honours or riches, in the midst of
the most splendid company, were the thoughts of his heart laid open, and his conversation
alone directed: it was a painful sacrifice indeed, to a noble nature like his, to accompany
the thoughtless and unprincipled set of beings he now was found amongst; but his too
accommodating nephew had intangled himself with them; and as he had so united his fate
to that of young Harrington, Sir Edward resolved to watch over, and prevent, if possible,
the fatal contagion of example over too easy a nature. Mr. Harrington, in person was manly and elegant, his manners polite and sweetly
fascinating, his heart benevolent, and his well cultivated understanding naturally
excellent; but his principles were wavering and inconstant: he loved and courted fashion
in her every form; but the nightly admonitions and reflections of his pillow often severely
reprehended the conduct of the day. Devoted to the sex, he thought no sacrifice too great
for the indulgence of all their little foibles or inclinations, however glaring or capricious. Though he was by no means fond of play, yet he was ensnared by the fine person and
polite manners of Lady Caroline, to lose to her immense sums, and sit for whole nights as
if nailed to her card-table; captivated by the enchanting witcheries of Lady Isabella's wit
and playful manner, he had addressed her in a strain of ardour in which his heart had no
share. Early instructed in the purest principles of virtue and religion, he once paid
unaffected homage to those sacred names; now he allowed himself to tread in the mazes
of scepticism, when he beheld one of Devotion's ministers scoff at her precepts, while he
revelled in luxury, and enjoyed, or seemed to enjoy, every species of worldly prosperity;
when his pious and virtuous curate, with his narrow pittance, struggled through life with
difficulty, and the hand of anxious care had stepped hastily before old age to implant the
wrinkles on his forehead. The fair and captivating atheist would often, with a smile and a look that would have
added grace to an Hebe, tell him, and seem to speak certain conviction to his mind, that
we certainly know what this life is;-but, from the other,
"-- No traveller returns
"To tell us what it is!" Though it was not in the power of Sir Charles Sefton to warm the heart of Lady
Isabella, yet she felt the full power of the hood-winked deity, in the fine person and
elegant acquirements of the seductive Harrington: how often did she dwell on the fond


idea of the rapture it would afford her, to live with him "the life of honour!" how often
has she turned in disgust from her declared admirer, and mentally exclaimed with Eloisa,
"Not Caesar's Empress would I deign to prove:
"Oh! make me mistress to the man I love!" With much anxiety did the penetrating Sir Edward discover the failings of his
nephew; which, though they took their rise from a mind too easily warped by fashion, had
yet attained no fixed seat in the heart, notwithstanding he dreaded and trembled for their
consequences; he saw, with extreme pain, the partiality of Lady Isabella towards him, and
how warmly, not to say at times how licentiously it had been returned by Frederic
Harrington! Sir Edward was often fearful that Lady Isabella had made a real and permanent
impression on his darling Frederic, and he would have shuddered at the bare idea of
seeing such a woman the wife of his beloved proteg�, whose gallantry, sometimes on the
other hand, towards Lady Caroline Leslie, had made him tremble; he knew the total want
of principle in that lady; and besides, Sir Edward was old-fashioned enough to think, that
though all virtuous and even affectionate friendship between the sexes is allowable, yet,
that very pointed gallantry in a young man towards a young married woman is as
reprehensible as it is imprudent, and sets a dangerous example to the ignorant and
untaught. He had therefore often felt much alarm, and had been ready to break through that
taciturnity he had determined to preserve, when he had beheld his nephew, as he has won
from Lady Caroline a considerable sum, fall at her feet, kiss her hand with rapture, and
solemnly declare that permission amply repaid him for all she had lost: and once Sir
Edward was really tempted to take him by the arm, and lead him out of the room, when
after being a most successful winner, and my lady not being able immediately to pay her
losings, he cancelled the debt on her lips. To see Frederic Harrington, was sufficient to admire him, and to be often in his
company, was to love and esteem him: Lady Caroline grew, by degrees, less fond of play;
though it still remained her darling sin: Sir Edward trembled for his nephew amidst this
dissipated circle, shuddered at the thought of his sullying the columns of a newspaper by
a detail of his trial at Westminster-Hall; and LESLIE versus HARRINGTON, darted in
terrific vision on his mind's eye, every time he took up the MORNING POST, HERALD,
or other vehicles of fashionable intelligence. At other times he would blame himself for his anxiety; and think, as he was growing
old, and uninitiated in the tenets of the new school, perhaps he might be getting surly and
cynical, or had entirely forgotten the bright sunshine of his youth. "No, no," he would
often say to himself, "Frederic can never be so preposterous as to be in love with both the
sisters at once! but what may not the advances of two fine unprincipled young women be
able to effect on a sanguine disposition? God defend him from seducing the wife of his
friend, however pretended that friend may be; and oh! may I never see him the husband
of that mischievous little infidel, Lady Isabella." The house of Mr. Marsham had a view of the gate which opened into the front
garden of the parsonage; and at the upper windows of the farm-house, Mary and Margaret
had stationed themselves to behold the great folks on their arrival. First, rattled on in high style, the Rector's barouche and four, driven by the
Honourable and Reverend Theodore Leslie, habited in a coachman's coat, with three
enormous capes; and, as he was an highly approved member of the whip-club, he drove in
such an admirable style, that, had not the good lady his mother been a truly chaste and
virtuous character, people might have thought he owed his birth to a GREGSONIAN
indiscretion. In the barouche were seated Lady Caroline, Frederic Harrington, and his uncle: and
rapidly darting after, with all the velocity of a charioteer, figured away Sir Charles Sefton,
in his lofty ph�ton, accompanied by Lady Isabella Emerson, arrayed in equestrian
costume: a small green cap added to all that knowing archness of her countenance which
was its peculiar character; while an habit of the same colour, laced with narrow gold
binding, as was her cap, and a pair of green satin half-boots, completed the fair-one's
livery. Sir Charles, adopting with true knight-errantry his lady's colours, was dressed in a
jacket of the same summer hue; and his white hat, lined only with green, gave a relief to
the verdant appearance of the dashing pair: but surely, the noble baronet had not studied
Ovid, who advises those only who are possessed of the roseate complexion of youth, to
wear this symbol of perpetual spring; for the yellow countenance of Sir Charles, in spite
of all the cosmetics he made use of, received an additional hue, of the cadaverous kind,
from the grass-tinged lining of his superfine beaver. Wrapped closely in a fine India shawl, which being drawn so tight round her fine
form, that it appeared her only covering, skipped out of her carriage, with all the grace
and agility of a wood-nymph, Lady Caroline Leslie, disclaiming all assistance from her
two attending beaux, who mutually offered their aid; but she was soon persuaded to take
the arm of the elegant Frederic, and the trees of the avenue which led to the house quickly
obscured them from the eyes of the gazing sisters.-"That," said Mary, "is the finest
gentleman I ever saw! the youngest, I mean, of the two who accompany Lady Caroline." "Oh!" said the emphatic Margaret, "I can look at no one but that knight in green, who I
am certain, from his complexion, is some foreign prince: they remind me, dear Mary, of
the green night and his lady: happy, happy fair-one, who is seated beside him in his car of
triumph!" The laughter which Mary was unable to suppress, highly offended her sister,
who regarded her with looks of contemptuous pity. "I declare," said Mary, "I think the
gentleman must be the happiest of the two, for she is really a very pretty lady; and I am
sure no one need envy her being seated by the side of such a yellow, unhealthy looking
being as the one you have been pleased to dub a prince: what a fortunate event, my dear
girl, it would have been for many a needy adventurer, had you been an absolute monarch! How many princes and nobles would have owed their origin to the prepossession you
might have received in their favour, from their personal appearance only!" Margaret made no answer, but gazed after the figure of Sir Charles as long as she
could perceive the least vestige of it gliding through the trees; then shutting the window,
and heaving a deep-drawn sigh, she accompanied her sister down stairs. Blest with each gift of nature and of art,
And wanting nothing but an honest heart,
Grown all to all, from no one vice exempt,
And most contemptible, to shun contempt;
A constant bounty, which no friend has made,
An Angel tongue, which no man can persuade;
A fool, with more of wit than half mankind,
Too rash for thought, for action too refin'd. POPE. MR. MARSHAM was truly respected by all the country, as an opulent and worthy
gentleman-farmer, and his genteel birth and respectable connexions made all the higher
classes of people desirous of cultivating his acquaintance. Ralph, however, disclaimed all
general visitors; and, as independent in his manners as in his fortune, he took the freedom
of choosing his associates, and the society which composed them he determined should
be as small as it was select. To his brother's Right Honourable Rector, his doors, of course, were thrown open;
and Ralph relaxed a little from his usual bluntness, to the great man, out of pure
friendship for his brothers. No being was more beloved than Edward, by all the parishioners; no one more
disliked and dreaded than the Honourable and Reverend Mr. Leslie; but the country-folks
had wit enough to keep their thoughts of him and his family to themselves.-Charles
Marsham, who, though no longer very young, was yet in possession of youth enough, and
health and strength sufficient to embark again in his favourite profession; and the
constant and flattering promises of the Reverend Mr. Leslie, to procure him, through his
interest and influence, rapid promotion, induced the kind-hearted Ralph to be more
obliging in his outward manners, than really accorded with his sincerity, to the man he
inwardly despised: not so Charles; for him it was an utter impossibility to cringe, in the
smallest degree, even to that man from whose favour he hoped to gain an ascendancy in
his military career; no, he would contradict the powerful Rector, where he thought him
wrong, with all the free impetuosity with which he would rebuke his own brothers or
nieces. The Rector, soon after his arrival, hastened to pay his respects at the farm-house,
assuring the honest trio that he had really languished to shake hands with three of the best
fellows in the universe; and that he now purposely called to request their company to
dinner on the following Thursday: the day being Saturday on which he chose to honour
them by a call, he thus continued, addressing Edward in particular: "Upon my soul, my
dear fellow, I am sadly unhinged by a succession of late hours, and have such a
confounded head-ach continually upon me, that I must request you will do duty for me tomorrow. "-"
With much pleasure, sir," replied Edward, "but I fear your parishioners will


be much disappointed, and particularly Lady Wringham, who has delayed the christening
of her infant till it was almost seven months old, in order that it might be baptised by your
hands. "-"What," says the reverend Rector, "has that old cat brought forth another child? Well, she gives devilish good douceurs, and I know she is so particular, that she will have
the dear cubs made literally members of the church, by having them brought there, like an
honest old laundress as she was,*-so I'll e'en try to get through a sermon, because if I
give out that I am indisposed, I cannot with any face sprinkle the monkey-forehead of
Lady Wringham's brat; no, no,-hang it, if one has no conscience, one must pretend to a
little." The virtuous Edward could scarce suppress his indignation, but he was poor and
dependent, his Rector rich and noble! he therefore bridled his thoughts, though with very
apparent difficulty, especially from the reply of Mr. Leslie to the following request:
"Sir," said Edward, "the poor woman's child, at the second cottage on the right of
your park, is so extremely ill, that she would esteem herself under a lasting obligation to
you, if you would be so kind to baptize it at home, as the apothecary tells her, the poor
infant's life, by great care, may be preserved; but if taken out in the air, at present, it will
inevitably cause its death. "-"Never, never," hastily replied Mr. Leslie, "will I christen
any of the poor at their own dwellings: I insist upon it, that she brings the unhappy little
wretch to church; and suppose it should die from cold, so much the better for the parents;
she has more mouths now in her dirty hovel than she is able to feed! * But oh! hang the
shop, my dear fellow, do not let us, as Lenitive says in the Prize, be "nailed to the counter
like a bad shilling!" I came to ask you to dine with me on Thursday; I mean to give my
parishioners a hop in the evening, illuminate the park, and let off a few crackers, in
honour of the Austrians having beat the French; but you, my good friends, and the divine
girls, your nieces, must positively come to dinner." "We are highly sensible of the honour you do us, sir," said Ralph: "on such an
occasion, we cannot refuse your polite invitation, and will certainly honour ourselves by
waiting on you. "-"Yes, sir," said Edward, "and now that I hear from you, that the
glorious news is really authentic, myself and family will also accept the invitation to a
ball with sincere pleasure." "So then," said the Rector, as he saw the young ladies enter
the room, and giving a very particular glance at Mary, "I am obliged only to Archduke
Charles for the company of you and these divine creatures! "-"Pardon me, sir," replied
Edward, "I too well know the distance between me, your humble curate, and that of your
noble family; my daughters are destined to move only in the sphere of humble mediocrity;
your family glitters in the court of a monarch, the brilliancy of which is only eclipsed by
the lustre of his virtues; but, on such an occasion as the present, the grateful incence of
humility finds equal acceptance with the triumphs of the high and mighty, at the crush of
usurpation and the victory of a virtuous warrior." "Pardon me, sir," said the right honourable Rector, as he gazed on the blushing face
of Mary, pressed her hand with ardour, and turned his back upon her sister, "pardon me,
my good sir, these lovely creatures would add glory to a crown!-do not, pray, my good
fellow, do not so depreciate their value." *Historique. *Historique. Mary turned from his bold and ardent gaze, then withdrawing her hand with some
dignity, she said, "Oh sir! do not think our minds are so untutored or so weak as to be
pleased with flattery so very pointed and gross." Mary then seated herself at the other end of the room, and her father, who felt for her,
said, "My girls, sir, are unused to the society of those who move in a sphere like that to
which you are ever accustomed; and therefore I have never sought to introduce them, as
guests, into that polished order of beings with whom I know it will never be their lot, in
future, to associate." "And why not? my good sir," said the Rector with quickness; "the acquisition of
such young ladies as the Misses Marsham must confer honour on society, instead of
deriving it." Margaret was not deaf on this occasion, and neither was she blind; she could see too
plainly that the pointed looks of the Rector towards her sister meant that she alone was
considered in the hyperbolical eulogium. Unmindful of his sacred profession, or his marriage vows, the Reverend Mr. Leslie
certainly beheld, with many a degree of painful comparison, in unison with a softer
sentiment, the innocent, blooming, and lovely Mary, and contrasted her with the gay,
unfeeling and unprincipled wife of his bosom; and if the conquest over her mind and
person was not attended with too much difficulty, it was his settled determination to
establish her in elegant lodgings, endow her with a comfortable settlement, and leave
her-when he was weary of her! For the other girl, he used to tell his family he thought
her confounded ugly, and a romantic fool; but to be too particular in his attentions to one
sister, while he totally neglected the other, would be to shew himself even a greater fool
than her he despised. "Well," continued he, resuming his friendly chit-chat, "you promise me, all of you, to
come; I hope we shall be very gay, and I will do all in my power to render the day and
evening agreeable to these lovely creatures (taking a hand of each, but looking at Mary
with much softness and meaning in his eyes): "good morning to you all;" and as he
leaped, with wonderful agility, the paling in front of the house, they all remarked at once,
"Who would think that was a clergyman?" And who would indeed think it was one of that serious profession, arrayed in nankin
jacket and trowsers, a green beaver hat, and a Belcher handkerchief tied round his throat;
but soon a dashing pair of females presented themselves, and turned back with him to the
farm-house. "We were in sight of your house, Mr. Marsham," said Lady Caroline, throwing
herself into an easy chair, and extending her pretty foot and ancle, while she discovered a
pair of fringed pantaloons, covered only with a thin muslin petticoat, and an open leno
pelisse, "we were coming after this stray sheep of mine, and have made him turn back
again." "If my brother turns back," said the lively Lady Isabella, "I fear he will have a
dreadful path to retread; do you not think so, sir?" added she, laying her hand familiarly
on the shoulder of the Reverend Mr. Marsham; "my sister talks of stray sheep; now thank
my stars, I am not one, for I never belonged to your pious fold, and,
"Pleas'd to the last, I'll crop the flow'ry food." "And is it not a pity," replied Edward, bowing with unaffected gravity, "that so
lovely a lamb should, unconsciously, be marked out for sacrifice? "-"What do you
mean?" said she, somewhat abashed. "Sacrificed," replied Edward, "on the altar of
fashion and dissipation."-"Oh! no," answered she with some haughtiness, "I am not
sacrificed, because I offer myself willingly; and am ever determined, in spite of parents,
husband, or clergy, to act in every thing as I please." Charles looked at her, in spite of her beauty, with disgust; and from that time
conceived a dislike against her; for though he hated a cold and tame character, yet he had
an utter aversion to what is generally styled a woman of spirit. But Charles had been himself a handsome fellow, and was so sensitive to the power
of beauty in the softer sex, that this sensibility was rather his weak side: Lady Isabella,
with great sweetness, advanced towards him, and took his un-reluctant hand; "Come
now," said she, "why do you give me that look, just like some American savage!" Margaret was captivated immediately; the sweet eyes of Lady Isabella, the
association of ideas, that the term American savage brought to her mind, was wonderful
in its operation, and she looked on Lady Isabella as little less than a divinity: the sly lady
also viewed the pensive Margaritta; and not only looked upon her as fair game for her
satiric talents, but her ladyship's penchant for the elegant Harrington encreasing daily,
she had imbibed some soft romantic sentiments with the passion of love, which made her
find a confidante an absolute requisite. She twisted the drapery of her long shawl around her with peculiar elegance, and
swam across the room to that space occupied by the nieces. "My sweet interesting girl!" said she, pressing the hand of Margaret, and with a soft sigh, fixing her eyes on her
countenance, "how happy am I to see you! and what pleasure do I enjoy, in prospect, at
the pleasing intelligence of your accepting our invitation for Thursday-oh!
