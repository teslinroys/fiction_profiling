"If you do not go, by all that's dear to me, I'll go myself," said the still weeping
lady. "Oh! my dear, that would be ten times more ridiculous; I'll go:-but do you think
Sir Charles will not deny her being in his house, if he wishes her to go with him?" "Oh! he cannot wish it," said she; "it is only her, a forward creature! Put him upon
his honour, he will not surely forfeit that!" "No, no, as a gentleman, I think he will not," said Mr. Davenport, and set off,
against his better judgment, to Sir Charles Sefton's. * Historique. That gentleman's party had just quitted him, and he instantly left his chamber, to
which he had retired for the remainder of the night, to wait on Mr. Davenport in the
drawing-room. Mr. Davenport entreated him to answer him as the man of honour and the
gentleman, whether he knew any thing of Miss Marsham? His ignorance, Sir Charles could safely plead; for it was near two hours since she
had quitted his house! and laying* his extended hand on his bosom, as the seat of
unblemished honour, and casting up his eyes, he called heaven, with the most solemn
asseverations, to witness that he had not seen her, neither was she in his house. "Search,
my dear friend," added he, "let not a single closet be unexplored. Why, what the deuce,
my good fellow, fond as I am of variety, do you think I am going to carry into a foreign
climate a woman who would discredit the angels of our own?-"No, no, hardly," said
Mr. Davenport, "only the situation she is in, you know, often softens the heart, and-"
"Bagatelle! my dear Davenport," interrupted the Baronet, with that chilling kind of
expression which shewed that circumstance had not in the least softened his heart. "Why," resumed Davenport, "as to your little caprice, en passant, with the poor
little unlucky devil, that is a mere bagatelle; I'm only d--d sorry it happened while she
was under our charge; but that is not to the present purpose. We know, in many instances,
my dear Sir Charles, you have proved your high sense of honour in several rencontres;
and in the honour of a man of your rank and fashion, implicit trust may be placed! I wish
you a good-night and a pleasant voyage, which I hope may fulfill all your wishes and
those of your friends, for the benefit of your health." Then with a few polite cong�es,
these votaries of modern honour took leave of each other. Sir Charles, on looking at his watch, found, instead of night, it was fast
approaching the hour of four in the morning; he therefore called to him his favourite
servant, the depository of all his secrets, and told him, that though he had not meant to
quit London till after nine o'clock, he would now go at eight, and therefore should not go
to bed at all. Not that he feared the calling of Margaret before the time he had
treacherously allotted her; for not thinking she would be desperate enough to stay out all
night, he rather thought she would never find it practicable to get out from Mr.
Davenport's at so early an hour, and though Mr. Davenport had told him she could no
where be found, he had little doubt but she would yet be there before his return to
Grosvenor-square; but yet, supposing she had not gone home, he should be many miles
on his journey before she would venture to call. Mrs. Davenport, not quite so well satisfied as her husband, of the honourable
principles of Sir Charles Sefton, anxiously awaited the morning visit of the Reverend
Edward Marsham. Edward wished to pay his respects that morning to his Right Honourable and
Reverend Rector; but, to present himself there for a morning visit before two o'clock in
the afternoon, would never do: an earlier hour must not be thought of either, for Mrs.
Davenport's levee; and he knew his Margaret was so pliable, that she no doubt implicitly
followed the steps of her patroness. Mrs. Davenport, however, rose that morning from her restless pillow earlier than
usual, so anxious was she for this visit to be over, in which she must inform a father of
the wanderings of his child; and ignorant where she had betaken herself, the dreadful idea



rushed on the mind of Mrs. Davenport, that perhaps she had, in terror at the arrival of her
father, taken her final leave of the world, and entered another uncalled and unprepared. This idea was strengthened by the return of Robert, her footman, whom she had sent to
various parts of the town, to discover, if possible, any tidings of her: he had heard, that a
young lady, exactly answering the description of Miss Marsham, in an elegantly made,
grey, corded sarsnet pelisse, and bonnet of the same, with black tassels, had been seen
wandering in the park at day-break, seemingly in great distress of mind. Mrs. Davenport's
good-natured disposition now made her detest the cruelty of Sir Charles Sefton, whom,
she made no doubt, had driven the unhappy girl from his presence, when Mr. Davenport
saw her at his door; and that she had in despair drowned herself in the canal. She knew
not how to act, she was half tempted to order her carriage and drive out, to avoid the sight
of her long-known and respected friend, and spare him the pangs which she must give to
his parental feelings: but then he had left word the evening before, that he would call
again, and Mrs. Davenport knew and practised the etiquette of politeness too correctly to
be out that morning. It was now past one, and at that hour Margaret was safely housed, and closely
concealed at the mysterious lodgings in St. James's-street; but how was she surprised,
when she found, as she looked up, that instead of being enfolded in the arms of her sister
(for she had rushed to her embrace without regarding the object), she perceived she was
clasped to the bosom of Lady Isabella Raymond! "Oh! Lady Isabella!" said the unhappy
girl, "cruel disappointment!" and from bodily weakness and various contending emotions,
she fainted away. When she revived, she found herself seated on a sofa by the bewitching Isabella,
who was administering restoratives to her with the tenderest concern, and weeping over
her. "Will you refuse," said she to her, "to the friend who loves you, your affection and
confidence?" "Oh! Lady Isabella," replied Margaret, "do I not see in you, disposed though I am,
and ever was, to love you, yet do I not behold the destroyer of my sister's peace and
happiness? "-"Are you then still possessed of the same narrow prejudices as when I first
knew you? and which I once endeavoured, and hoped I had succeeded in the attempt to
eradicate from a soaring mind like yours? Tell me, pray, what are kindred ties to those the
affections of the soul approve? Are we under any obligation to those who usher us into a
world which the cruelty of man renders a scene of tears and anguish! And what claim
have those on our affections, which they present to us under the titles of brothers and
sisters? and these, however undeserving, they would compel us to love, because they are
their children. How often have I told you, and you once paid deference to my
understanding, that all love should be free, nor bound and manacled by human ties: the
same of course holds good in friendship, which is but love refined, and exalted to that
purity which owns no sexual attachment. Man talks of love: alas! few men know what it
is. Man has forsaken me! Yes, the once idolized Isabella is forsaken by all she most loves. Oh! Do not, Margaritta, add to the number, do not thou forsake me." Margaret sank, weeping, on the bosom of this female sophist: by degrees her
repugnance wore off at the idea of uniting her fate to that of the woman who had seduced


the husband of her sister, and ere two hours had past, she felt for her the warmest
affection and admiration. She consented to share with her, her home and fortune; and as concealment on
each side was absolutely requisite, they were discoverable to no one, from the recluse
manner in which they lived, each lady taking the name of her perfidious lover-Mrs.
Frederic, and Mrs. Charles; reporting themselves to the land-lady of the house, who was
not very particular or tenacious about her lodgers, as the wives of officers, who were
abroad. Margaret soon imbibed all the deadly poison of Lady Isabella's opinions, who
succeeded in making her think that what each of them had been guilty of was no crime,
and that inclinations would never have been given us, if they were not to be gratified: she
taught her to glory in their present friendship, which, sacred and liberal in itself, disdained
the common-place opinion of the world, or the unavoidable ties of kindred; and so much
did she need the soothings of a friend herself, so much consolation did she feel in talking
over her own misfortunes to Margaret, and in the good-nature and real good heart of this
poor unfortunate, that Lady Isabella really felt for her all the friendship she had, in the
commencement of their acquaintance, only feigned. "We are fellow sufferers, my Margaret," she would say, "both have suffered by
the perfidy of men, who now forsake us. Sir Charles is the most inhuman villain of the
two: for I am not, my poor girl, I am not in your situation; if I was, I very well know how
I should act. How hard are early prejudices to root from the mind! Harrington, the
sentimental Harrington, will not for me forswear all future commerce with his wife, if she
does condescend to forgive him; no, he will gratefully, he says, accept her forgiveness! He will not, as I request him, devote his life to me and me alone, on the shores of the
Atlantic; we therefore meet no more! Nor will I accept the least assistance from him,
though his liberality would furnish me amply: but fear not, we shall not want, my dear
girl; I have money sufficient for two months: and then I have a beautiful set of diamonds
to dispose of, which will support us for some time. But I would trust all to chance, my
only deity, sooner than be obliged to him for pecuniary aid, who will not make for me the
trifling sacrifice I have required." Margaret, however, though she did not contradict her ladyship, thought the giving
up so lovely a creature as her sister Mary, and a lawful wife beside, was no such trifling
sacrifice! notwithstanding the beauty of the lady before her was so resplendent: but she
now estimated more the great mind of her ladyship, who, generously braving the opinions
of a cruel and illiberal world, had intreated and implored, when she saw Margaritta on the
point of perishing, and not knowing where to betake herself, not only that she would
share her lot, but promised, if any thing should happen, to deprive her of her protection,
that she would recommend her to the care of a sister, who lived in affluence, but who
having yielded to the soft passion for another man besides her husband (for she was
married), and followed the dictates of nature (though she had forsaken her* three children
to indulge her illicit inclination), had become obliged to forego respectable society, yet
Lady Isabella assured Margaret was a most liberal-minded woman, and would take the
tenderest care of her and her child . . . .Yet this tender lady had forsaken her own!!! "As to my sister, Caroline," said Lady Isabella, "with more faults than you and I
have hairs on our heads, amongst which is that love-repelling, odious vice of gaming,
says, forsooth, she will never look upon me again! While her husband, who preaches a
doctrine he cannot believe, because he shews his disbelief by his daily practice, inveighs
against my conduct, which, he says, will absolutely prevent my ever filling again those
circles I had once a right to move amongst! Yet, to gratify their own family pride, and
keep up the respectability of our rank, they are endeavouring to accommodate matters,
and prevent a trial, with its consequent divorce; for a divorce, they say, must ever prove a
wife to be guilty! Whereas a separation only makes the wife received and pitied as a
sufferer; she can tell her own story, and having an husband in many degrees unworthy, he
is often looked upon as the sole transgressor: poor subterfuges, my Margaritta. However,
the detestable Raymond can never allow me a maintenance of separation, but what must
be trifling indeed; for nothing but being ordered abroad and eluding his creditors, can
save him much longer from the King's Bench; the confines of which have long groaned
for him. His friends, perhaps, conscious that he endeavoured to sell me to old Lord
Fenwater, and also knowing that he purposely gave me every opportunity with
Harrington, may try (to prevent his being sent to Coventry by the whole army) to make up
a purse for him, or rather for me: some of them are very wealthy. If a trial at Westminster-
Hall must take place, so be it; I have been guilty of no crime, and Isabella Emerson will
never live to be the public scorn, or be in any way publicly disgraced, nor an outcast from
any one of those circles she has been accustomed once to honour by her presence." Though every word this independent spirited lady uttered served but to convince
Margaret of the superiority and greatness of her mind, yet she could not help frequently
remarking to herself, how much the late agitations of that mind had impaired her person:
life, spirit, and vivacity no longer sparkled in her now anxious eyes; no more the arch
smile embellished her lovely mouth, nor the elegant repart�e escape it: instead of the
keen and pointed satire tempered with genteel, though original wit, which used to enliven
her conversation, as they now spoke to each other of their absent friends, to the
recollection of some she gave a sigh,-on others she bestowed the strong expressions of
anger and malevolence. The mind of Lady Isabella was not, naturally, intended for the throne of vice:
education, the prevalence of fashion, the ill examples of her nearest relations, with the
books she perused from her girlish days, had warped, and almost entirely overset the few
good principles inherent in her, and caused her to give way to the free indulgence of any
favourite inclination: the pride and obstinacy of self-will made her continue in any
opinion she once thought proper to receive, even though her heart or her mature judgment
condemned it: rashness and impetuosity governed her conduct; and to shew her
independence of her relatives, and her contempt of the world, she would, in the
momentary impulse of haughty vexation, exercise her revenge on those who would dare
to contradict or restrain her, even though she inflicted vengeance on herself. Such chiefly
was her motive for her marriage with Major Raymond; and of this imprudent and hasty
marriage the reader has already seen the result. The passions of Lady Isabella were warm, her affections ardent, and her
friendship, if it once took root, even if misplaced, was sincere: had she been differently
educated, though her mind was by no means faultless, and though her temper was


naturally severe and mischievous, yet, if in early youth her fine sense had been taught to
take a proper bent, she would, with her native energies, have been as conspicuous for her
virtue, as for her contempt of that ornament to the female character, and her mind would
have become as excellent as it was great. It is a painful reflection on the bounded limits of all human worth, but there
certainly are some characters, wherein the weeds of pride and passion so choke the latent,
but yet not extinct virtues, that they must sink before they can rise: the commission of
some crime must abash the haughty countenance, and bend down the lofty head, that
towers in all the pride and insolence of mistaken virtue, or rather the pride of an unsullied
reputation, (for true virtue is meek and humble). Misfortune and neglect must shew them
their dependence on the kindness of their inferiors in worldly rank; and as they feel their
own littleness before superior goodness, they will be sedulously emulous and ambitious
of becoming good likewise. Asylum sad! from reason, hope, and Heaven! YOUNG. IT is in vain to describe the agitation of Mrs. Davenport, when the Reverend
Edward Marsham entered her boudoir, and the feelings of the father, when he heard from
her the fatal lapse of his child from the path of virtue, and her elopement. With anguish unspeakable, he took his leave, and after traversing the whole town,
in the hope of meeting her, his intention was, if he succeeded in his search, to call the
wanderer back to peace and hope by his kind forgiveness. This truly christian divine felt
no emotions of unrelenting wrath against his daughter; but wished only to heal the
lacerated heart of the credulous girl, who had been misled by the artifice of a villain. After many perplexing conjectures, it struck him that it was more than probable
she had accompanied her seducer on his voyage. On the honour of a wretch, who had
thus, with cruel wantonness, dishonoured his daughter, he placed no reliance; though
Mrs. Davenport had laid so much stress on it, and he doubted not but she was actually in
the house at the very time he requested Mr. Davenport to search every corner of it; for the
painful intelligence which Robert had brought from the Park, Mrs. Davenport had
carefully concealed from a parent, already but too much anguished by the afflicting
information which she had imparted. Worn out by fatigue, sorrow, and disappointment, he returned to St. James'ssquare;
he retired to his chamber and sent his respects to Sir Edward, and that, not finding
himself very well, he hoped he would excuse his attendance at dinner. Now alone, and freed from the busy unfeeling throng, who had passed him in the
public streets, all employed, regardless of other's concerns, in the pursuit of their own
individual business or pleasure, he reflected seriously on what course he had best take,
and how to make known to his worthy friend this disgrace, and the additional sorrow
which now assailed him; for, to conceal any part of his concerns from such a friend, he
deemed unpardonable. Sir Edward ordered that his dinner might be sent up to him, and which went
accompanied by his kindest and most affectionate enquiries after his health: in vain the
unhappy man essayed to eat; and while Sir Edward was taking his wine, he joined him in
the parlour, and informed him of the fatal circumstance which had happened, without
reserve. "There remains little doubt, my worthy friend," said Sir Edward, "but that Sir
Charles Sefton has taken off your daughter: I know that he sails to-morrow early, because
I am intimately acquainted with a gentleman who goes in the same vessel; and it is now
seven o'clock; not winged horses could reach the port now, before they will be off. I have
no acquaintance with Sir Charles, further than that I formed with him at the parsonage at
Eglantine, and which ceased at my departure; for he was a man I ever despised: but I will
immediately write to my friend, and the letter will arrive nearly as soon on the island as


they do: he can inform me if Sir Charles has a lady with him answering your daughter's
description. In the mean time, dear friend, do not sink, Providence watches over the good;
to that small, select class I am sure you belong, and he will not afflict those, his only
chosen, with more than they are able to bear. We will go down to Twickenham, for a few
days, to that excellent sufferer, our dear Mary: remember, my worthy friend, it behoves
you, as much as possible, to pour the balm of paternal comfort into her bleeding heart;
and for this, I am sure, you will see how needful it is for you to exert all your energies:
and we must patiently wait the event of hearing of your other daughter, by the next
accounts from Madeira; for I have not the least doubt but that she has prevailed on Sir
Charles to take her with him: she expected, daily, your arrival in town, and dreaded to
encounter the anger of a virtuous parent. Make yourself easy, my excellent friend; when I
certainly find she is with Sir Charles, I will compel him to do her justice." "That, sir, he
can never do," replied Edward, "and wretched and infamous as is her present lot, I should
be sorry to see her the wife of such a man!" It was in vain for poor Edward Marsham that night to press his pillow with his
aching head: alas! the heart ached so much more, that sleep fled his eye-lids the whole
night; and it was absolutely requisite to remove him from town, had he not even owned
the dear tie which called him to Twickenham. In about three or four days, Sir Edward and Mr. Marsham came to town: as the
former was now anxious to present the worthy Curate to the Chancellor, they called on
him in their way home; but found, more to the disappointment of Sir Edward, than the
heart-broken Mr. Marsham, that the benefice had been given away a few days before: the
Chancellor, however, made most fervent promises of very soon providing for one, who
was so urgently recommended by his friend, Sir Edward Harrington, and whom, on his
own account, he felt sincerely desirous of serving. Such a flattering reception from one so high in rank and power, would at one time
have imparted much pleasureable hope to the mind of Edward, but now that mind was
only alive to sorrow; hope could no more allure, nor the prospect of an easy competency
any longer gratify, which, on account of bequeathing something to his poor Margaret,
would once, had she remained virtuous, have been the summit of his earthly wishes. He left Sir Edward in Pall-mall, where he was engaged to dine with a very
particular friend, and where he much wished to persuade Edward Marsham to accompany
him, for change of scene, and to dissipate his thoughts; but the Curate intreated so
earnestly to be excused, that Sir Edward was obliged to acquiesce. After he had taken a solitary dinner, a note was brought him by a servant, who left
it, saying it required no answer. He saw the seal was engraved with the arms of the Leslie
family; and on hastily breaking it, he read the following words:
"Sir,
I was extremely surprised to find that you left your cure, without first writing to
me, to obtain my permission." [Edward here could not forbear smiling, for this was an
ecclesiastical despotism he had never heard of before.] "This I would have looked over,
but you might have been polite enough to have called on me, after your arrival in town,
and informed me of your reasons for thus quitting your parochial duty. However, sir, I
write to inform you, another Curate is appointed in your place. I am,
Sir, &c.
THEODORE LESLIE"
"I am now," thought Edward, "bereft of all but the scanty pittance left me by my
sister: on that I cannot possibly exist. Can I bear the idea of becoming a dependant on the
bounty of Sir Edward Harrington? That must never be! And my son-in-law will soon
diminish his noble fortune to help to pay those exorbitant damages which Major
Raymond has laid against him." For the town now rang with the approaching trial. Major Raymond scorned all
accommodation urged for, both by the Leslie and Harrington families: the one, he
resolved to humble for their former contempt of him, when he married into the family;
the other, he looked upon as the golden mine, which would compensate him for that
dishonour he had aided and connived at. In order that Harrington should satisfy all his
creditors, some of his claim he had discharged, with the immense sums he had already
borrowed from the thoughtless Frederic. Though he had, at first, winked at the infidelity of his wife, yet her own conduct
had been truly reprehensible; and Harrington's fault was so aggravated by his recent
marriage with a woman he once adored, it was expected that Major Raymond would
succeed in obtaining every shilling of his damages, which he laid at sixty thousand
pounds! Edward sat some time in that scheming kind of various thought, which fixes upon
nothing, when a faint sickness came over him; and being a beautiful night, and rather
warm for the season, he walked towards the Green Park, to try the effect of the air, to
ponder over his misfortunes, and await the next morning for action and exertion, which
would now become requisite towards his own support. As he knew the keeper of the gate, he rang, and asked his permission to walk
round the bason: after taking two or three turns, it began to grow somewhat dark, from
the moon being under a cloud, which appeared to threaten rain: he discovered during this
obscurity something white, like two female figures, who appeared to move towards the
grove. Whether from an irresistible impulse of curiosity, or only with a view of
dissipating his wretched thoughts, he knew not, but he rose with caution, and followed
with softly stealing step after them, till he drew near, and then concealed himself among
the trees. One of them addressed the other in a very low voice, as follows: "I think the Park
is totally empty. Now, my friend, my comforter in affliction, give me a last embrace!" The other figure fell on her knees, and answered her; but her voice seemed hoarse and
scarcely articulate, and as if she laboured under a severe cold. "Think, oh! think, my dear
friend," said she, "Oh! let us reflect, before it will be too late. "-"Cowardice and
prejudice, I see," said the other, "have so taken root in your mind, that nothing will be
able to do them away. Farewell! go to that home which we left, and to which I have bade
an eternal adieu! they will receive you: go to my sister Beatrice, tell her you come from
me, she will assist you. "-"To all that may concern myself," said the other, "you have
conquered every prejudice: but shall I not commit a double murder, by destroying with
myself, my unborn child? "-"Better is it," said her companion, "to give it peace by death,


than usher it into this world of misery: oh! if it should be a daughter, you deliver it from
man, its greatest future enemy. "-"But do not we, ourselves," said the other, "make this
world a scene of misery?" "Farewell," said she, whose daring mind seemed most under
the influence of despair, "a moment is too long to live, after the upbraidings of a friend;
and if I have been guilty, and there is a future state of punishment, I hasten to receive my
deserts; but my chastisement shall be inflicted by a superior being to the sons and
daughters of mortality." She then dragged herself from her friend, who still endeavoured
to cling to her, crying, "No, no, living or dying, my lot shall never be separated from
yours."
