So I set
myself to consider what was the best way of proceeding; and truly upon
reflection, there are few events in my history that I look back upon with
more satisfaction than the part I performed in this matter; for, before
going into any division of the money, I proposed that we should allot it
to three classes--those who were destitute; those who had some help, but
large families; and those to whom a temporality would be sufficient--and
that we should make a visitation to the houses of all the sufferers, in
order to class them under their proper heads aright. By this method, and
together with what I had done personally in the tempest, I got great
praise and laud from all reflecting people; and it is not now to be told
what a consolation was brought to many a sorrowful widow and orphan's
heart, by the patience and temperance with which the fund of liberality
was distributed; yet because a small sum was reserved to help some of the
more helpless at another time, and the same was put out to interest in
the town's books, there were not wanting evil-minded persons who went
about whispering calumnious innuendos to my disadvantage; but I know, by
this time, the nature of the world, and how impossible it is to reason
with such a seven-headed and ten-horned beast as the multitude. So I
said nothing; only I got the town-clerk's young man, who acted as clerk
to the committee of the subscription, to make out a fair account of the
distribution of the money, and to what intent the residue had been placed
in the town-treasurer's hand; and this I sent unto a friend in Glasgow to
get printed for me, the which he did; and when I got the copies, I
directed one to every individual subscriber, and sent the town-drummer an
end's errand with them, which was altogether a proceeding of a method and
exactness so by common, that it not only quenched the envy of spite
utterly out, but contributed more and more to give me weight and
authority with the community, until I had the whole sway and mastery of
the town. Death is a great reformer of corporate bodies, and we found, now and
then, the benefit of his helping hand in our royal burgh. From the time
of my being chosen into the council; and, indeed, for some years before,
Mr Hirple had been a member, but, from some secret and unexpressed
understanding among us, he was never made a bailie; for he was not liked;
having none of that furthy and jocose spirit so becoming in a magistrate
of that degree, and to which the gifts of gravity and formality make but
an unsubstantial substitute. He was, on the contrary, a queer and
quistical man, of a small stature of body, with an outshot breast, the
which, I am inclined to think, was one of the main causes of our never
promoting him into the ostensible magistracy; besides, his temper was
exceedingly brittle; and in the debates anent the weightiest concerns of
the public, he was apt to puff and fiz, and go off with a pluff of anger
like a pioye; so that, for the space of more than five-and-twenty years,
we would have been glad of his resignation; and, in the heat of argument,
there was no lack of hints to that effect from more than one of his
friends, especially from Bailie Picken, who was himself a sharp-tempered
individual, and could as ill sit quiet under a contradiction as any man I
ever was conjunct with. But just before the close of my second
provostry, Providence was kind to Mr Hirple, and removed him gently away
from the cares, and troubles, and the vain policy of this contending
world, into, as I hope and trust, a far better place. It may seem, hereafter, to the unlearned readers among posterity,
particularly to such of them as may happen not to be versed in that state
of things which we were obligated to endure, very strange that I should
make this special mention of Mr Hirple at his latter end, seeing and
observing the small store and account I have thus set upon his talents
and personalities. But the verity of the reason is plainly this: we
never discovered his worth and value till we had lost him, or rather,
till we found the defect and gap that his death caused, and the
affliction that came in through it upon us in the ill-advised selection
of Mr Hickery to fill his vacant place. The spunky nature of Mr Hirple was certainly very disagreeable often to
most of the council, especially when there was any difference of opinion;
but then it was only a sort of flash, and at the vote he always, like a
reasonable man, sided with the majority, and never after attempted to rip
up a decision when it was once so settled. Mr Hickery was just the even
down reverse of this. He never, to be sure, ran himself into a passion,
but then he continued to speak and argue so long in reply, never heeding
the most rational things of his adversaries, that he was sure to put
every other person in a rage; in addition to all which, he was likewise a
sorrowful body in never being able to understand how a determination by
vote ought to and did put an end to every questionable proceeding; so
that he was, for a constancy, ever harping about the last subject
discussed, as if it had not been decided, until a new difference of
opinion arose, and necessitated him to change the burden and o'ercome of
his wearysome speeches. It may seem remarkable that we should have taken such a plague into the
council, and be thought that we were well served for our folly; but we
were unacquaint with the character of the man--for although a native of
the town, he was in truth a stranger, having, at an early age, espoused
his fortune, and gone to Philadelphia in America; and no doubt his argol-
bargolous disposition was an inheritance accumulated with his other
conquest of wealth from the mannerless Yankees. Coming home and settling
among us, with a power of money, (some said eleven thousand pounds,) a
short time before Mr Hirple departed this life, we all thought, on that
event happening, it would be a very proper compliment to take Mr Hickery
into the council, and accordingly we were so misfortunate as to do so;
but I trow we soon had reason to repent our indiscretion, and none more
than myself, who had first proposed him. Mr Hickery having been chosen to supply the void caused by the death of
Mr Hirple, in the very first sederunt of the council after his election,
he kithed in his true colours. Among other things that I had contemplated for the ornament and
edification of the burgh, was the placing up of lamps to light the
streets, such as may be seen in all well regulated cities and towns of
any degree. Having spoken of this patriotic project to several of my
colleagues, who all highly approved of the same, I had no jealousy or
suspicion that a design so clearly and luminously useful would meet with
any other opposition than, may be, some doubt as to the fiscal abilities
of our income. To be sure Mr Dribbles, who at that time kept the head
inns, and was in the council, said, with a wink, that it might be found
an inconvenience to sober folk that happened, on an occasion now and
then, to be an hour later than usual among their friends, either at his
house or any other, to be shown by the lamps to the profane populace as
they were making the best of their way home; and Mr Dippings, the
candlemaker, with less public spirit than might have been expected from
one who made such a penny by the illuminations on news of victory, was of
opinion that lamps would only encourage the commonality to keep late
hours; and that the gentry were in no need of any thing of the sort,
having their own handsome glass lanterns, with two candles in them,
garnished and adorned with clippit paper; an equipage which he prophesied
would soon wear out of fashion when lamps were once introduced, and the
which prediction I have lived to see verified; for certainly, now-a-days,
except when some elderly widow lady, or maiden gentlewoman, wanting the
help and protection of man, happens to be out at her tea and supper, a
tight and snod serving lassie, with a three-cornered glass lantern, is
never seen on the causey. But, to return from this digression; saving
and excepting the remarks of Mr Dribbles and Mr Dippings, and neither of
them could be considered as made in a sincere frame of mind, I had no
foretaste of any opposition. I was, therefore, but ill prepared for the
worrying argument with which Mr Hickery seized upon the scheme, asserting
and maintaining, among other apparatus-like reasoning, that in such a
northern climate as that of Scotland, and where the twilight was of such
long duration, it would be a profligate waste of the public money to
employ it on any thing so little required as lamps were in our streets. He had come home from America in the summer time, and I reminded him,
that it certainly could never be the intention of the magistrates to
light the lamps all the year round; but that in the winter there was a
great need of them; for in our northern climate the days were then very
short, as he would soon experience, and might probably recollect. But
never, surely, was such an endless man created. For, upon this, he
immediately rejoined, that the streets would be much more effectually
lighted, than by all the lamps I proposed to put up, were the inhabitants
ordered to sit with their window-shutters open. I really did not know
what answer to make to such a proposal, but I saw it would never do to
argue with him; so I held my tongue quietly, and as soon as possible, on
a pretence of private business, left the meeting, not a little mortified
to find such a contrary spirit had got in among us. After that meeting of the council, I went cannily round to all the other
members, and represented to them, one by one, how proper it was that the
lamps should be set up, both for a credit to the town, and as a
conformity to the fashion of the age in every other place. And I took
occasion to descant, at some length, on the untractable nature of Mr
Hickery, and how it would be proper before the next meeting to agree to
say nothing when the matter was again brought on the carpet, but just to
come to the vote at once. Accordingly this was done, but it made no
difference to Mr Hickery; on the contrary, he said, in a vehement manner,
that he was sure there must be some corrupt understanding among us,
otherwise a matter of such importance could not have been decided by a
silent vote; and at every session of the council, till some new matter of
difference cast up, he continued cuckooing about the lamp-job, as he
called it, till he had sickened every body out of all patience. The first question that changed the bark of Mr Hickery, was my proposal
for the side plainstones of the high street. In the new paving of the
crown of the causey, some years before, the rise in the middle had been
levelled to an equality with the side loans, and in disposing of the lamp-
posts, it was thought advantageous to place them halfway from the houses
and the syvers, between the loans and the crown of the causey, which had
the effect at night, of making the people who were wont, in their travels
and visitations, to keep the middle of the street, to diverge into the
space and path between the lamp-posts and the houses. This, especially
in wet weather, was attended with some disadvantages; for the pavement,
close to the houses, was not well laid, and there being then no ronns to
the houses, at every other place, particularly where the nepus-gables
were towards the streets, the rain came gushing in a spout, like as if
the windows of heaven were opened. And, in consequence, it began to be
freely conversed, that there would be a great comfort in having the sides
of the streets paved with flags, like the plainstones of Glasgow, and
that an obligation should be laid on the landlords, to put up ronns to
kepp the rain, and to conduct the water down in pipes by the sides of the
houses;--all which furnished Mr Hickery with fresh topics for his
fasherie about the lamps, and was, as he said, proof and demonstration of
that most impolitic, corrupt, and short-sighted job, the consequences of
which would reach, in the shape of some new tax, every ramification of
society;--with divers other American argumentatives to the same effect. However, in process of time, by a judicious handling and the help of an
advantageous free grassum, which we got for some of the town lands from
Mr Shuttlethrift the manufacturer, who was desirous to build a
villa-house, we got the flagstone part of the project accomplished, and
the landlords gradually, of their own free-will, put up the ronns, by
which the town has been greatly improved and convenienced. But new occasions call for new laws; the side pavement, concentrating the
people, required to be kept cleaner, and in better order, than when the
whole width of the street was in use; so that the magistrates were
constrained to make regulations concerning the same, and to enact fines
and penalties against those who neglected to scrape and wash the
plainstones forenent their houses, and to denounce, in the strictest
terms, the emptying of improper utensils on the same; and this, until the
people had grown into the habitude of attending to the rules, gave rise
to many pleas, and contentious appeals and bickerings, before the
magistrates. Among others summoned before me for default, was one Mrs
Fenton, commonly called the Tappit-hen, who kept a small change-house,
not of the best repute, being frequented by young men, of a station of
life that gave her heart and countenance to be bardy, even to the
bailies. It happened that, by some inattention, she had, one frosty
morning, neglected to soop her flags, and old Miss Peggy Dainty being
early afoot, in passing her door committed a false step, by treading on a
bit of a lemon's skin, and her heels flying up, down she fell on her
back, at full length, with a great cloyt. Mrs Fenton, hearing the
accident, came running to the door, and seeing the exposure that perjink
Miss Peggy had made of herself, put her hands to her sides, and laughed
for some time as if she was by herself. Miss Peggy, being sorely hurt in
the hinder parts, summoned Mrs Fenton before me, where the whole affair,
both as to what was seen and heard, was so described, with name and
surname, that I could not keep my composure. It was, however, made
manifest, that Mrs Fenton had offended the law, in so much, as her flags
had not been swept that morning; and therefore, to appease the offended
delicacy of Miss Peggy, who was a most respectable lady in single life, I
fined the delinquent five shillings. "Mr Pawkie," said the latheron, "I'll no pay't. Whar do ye expeck a
widow woman like me can get five shillings for ony sic nonsense?" "Ye must not speak in that manner, honest woman," was my reply; "but just
pay the fine." "In deed and truth, Mr Pawkie," quo she, "it's ill getting a breek off a
highlandman. I'll pay no sic thing--five shillings--that's a story!" I thought I would have been constrained to send her to prison, the woman
grew so bold and contumacious, when Mr Hickery came in, and hearing what
was going forward, was evidently working himself up to take the randy's
part; but fortunately she had a suspicion that all the town-council and
magistrates were in league against her, on account of the repute of her
house, so that when he enquired of her where she lived, with a view, as I
suspect, of interceding, she turned to him, and with a leer and a laugh,
said, "Dear me, Mr Hickery, I'm sure ye hae nae need to speer that!" The insinuation set up his birses; but she bamboozled him with her
banter, and raised such a laugh against him, that he was fairly driven
from the council room, and I was myself obliged to let her go, without
exacting the fine. Who would have thought that this affair was to prove to me the means of
an easy riddance of Mr Hickery? But so it turned out; for whether or not
there was any foundation for the traffickings with him which she
pretended, he never could abide to hear the story alluded to, which, when
I discerned, I took care, whenever he showed any sort of inclination to
molest the council with his propugnacity, to joke him about his bonny
sweetheart, "the Tappit-hen," and he instantly sang dumb, and quietly
slipped away; by which it may be seen how curiously events come to pass,
since, out of the very first cause of his thwarting me in the lamps, I
found, in process of time, a way of silencing him far better than any
sort of truth or reason. I have already related, at full length, many of the particulars anent the
electing of the first set of volunteers; the which, by being germinated
partly under the old system of public intromission, was done with more
management and slight of art than the second. This, however, I will ever
maintain, was not owing to any greater spirit of corruption; but only and
solely to following the ancient dexterous ways, that had been, in a
manner, engrained with the very nature of every thing pertaining to the
representation of government as it existed, not merely in burgh towns,
but wheresoever the crown and ministers found it expedient to have their
lion's paw. Matters were brought to a bearing differently, when, in the second
edition of the late war, it was thought necessary to call on the people
to resist the rampageous ambition of Bonaparte, then champing and
trampling for the rich pastures of our national commonwealth. Accordingly, I kept myself aloof from all handling in the pecuniaries of
the business; but I lent a friendly countenance to every feasible project
that was likely to strengthen the confidence of the king in the loyalty
and bravery of his people.
