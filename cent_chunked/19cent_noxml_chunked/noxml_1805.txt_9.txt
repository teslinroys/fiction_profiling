All his treasures of this sort were brought into the

common stock. In this happy family there were no discordant opinions, no one ready to say, "This is rash; that is singular; this is contrary to the judgment
of
the world; you must learn to think like others, or you must expect to be disliked;" and thus to chill the opening blossoms of reflection and of mind. They
needed not to be told, that he who is afraid to think unlike others, will soon learn, in every honourable sense of the word, not to think at all. Mr. Macneil, after he had withdrawn from the conversation of the gentlemen of the neighbourhood, had found himself intruded

upon by stragglers, whom the fashion of an excursion to the lakes had brought to his door. Some came with letters of recommendation, and some without. Some
were induced by curiosity to see the friend of Jean Jacques Rousseau, and some to see the lady who had two husbands, both of them living. With the improper
conduct and indelicacy of one or two of these wanderers mr. Macneil had been highly displeased. He had desired his friends to yield no more letters of
introduction to the mere importunities of the idle. He saw no reason why he should suffer his time to be intruded upon, and his serenity to be ruffled, by
the
curiosity of indolent travellers who did not know how to dispose of themselves. The lady, the advocate of mrs. Macneil, to whom I communicated my wish, did
not
fail therefore to assure me, that I should not gain entrance over the threshold of their house. This

unfavourable prediction perhaps piqued me the more, and I sat down, and addressed the following letter to the gentleman whose acquaintance I was desirous to
obtain. SIR,
I have heard your character described in a way so peculiarly conformable to my notions and predilections, that I am desirous to be indulged with an hour of
your conversation. You have been intruded upon, I am told, by the idle and the frivolous; you are a lover of solitude; you are happy in the bosom of your family: these are the
reasons which have been alleged to me, why I ought not to expect to obtain the favour I solicit. I shall at least weaken the objections which have been
urged,
if I can satisfy you that I am not of the class of the persons who have occasioned your displeasure. I am no curious man: what have I to be curious about? I am nearly forty-five years of age. I have seen the world, through all its gradations, and in most of
the countries of Europe. In my youth I was a wild roe among the mountains of Wales: as I grew up, I entered upon the scenes of active life, foolishly, not
criminally. I contracted an early distaste for the practices and the society of the world. I have lived much alone ---I have not been happy. When I have gone

into company, mere acquaintance have not interested me; a friend (a friend, in the perhaps romantic sense of the word) I never found. I am no doubt a very
weak
creature; I am not like Solomon's good man, "satisfied from myself." Such is my history; am I one of those persons whose intrusion you would wish to forbid? Why am I desirous to pay one visit to the roof of mr. Macneil? I know not

whether the answer I can give to this question, will be or ought to be satisfactory. I am not idle enough to imagine that our interview will improve into
acquaintance, far less into friendship. We dwell in different and remote parts of the island; we cannot be acquaintance. My habits and temper (it is a
million
chances to one) will not suit you; in those indescribable minutiï¿½, which do not affect the essentials of a character, but which make each man an individual
by
himself, and which divide you from the rest of your species, you will probably not be approved by me: we cannot be friends. What then? You are, I believe, a

good and a wise man (two qualities much more inseparable than the world is willing to allow): I have found so few of these, as sometimes to be almost tempted

to think that the race is growing extinct; and I would not willingly miss an opportunity

of seeing so extraordinary a creature. Your family is happy---(Oh, happiness! thou perpetual object of pursuit! always showing thyself in prospect! always cut
off from our attainment by insurmountable precipices and impassable torrents!) ---do not refuse me the sight of a happy family! I ask only for a transient and

momentary pleasure! I ask only for something to stock my memory with, the recollection of which I may call up from time to time, and with the image of which
I
may gild my solitude! I am, sir,
your very humble servant,
Casimir Fleetwood
of Merionethsbire. Lowood Inn,
Ambleside. My application had the desired issue. A polite answer was returned, expressing that mr. Macneil would be happy to be favoured with my visit. I was the more
flattered with this, as the lady to whom I had mentioned my desire, a woman of no common sagacity, had predicted a different event. I hastened to make use of the privilege I had obtained. I found the house of mr. Macneil uncommonly plain in its style, yet replete with every temperate
convenience. The father of the family seemed to be upward of fifty years of age, and was tall, robust and manly in his appearance. His hair was brown, short

and unpowdered; his ruddy cheek confessed that he was not negligent of

the care of his fields, and that he had received in his constitution the reward of his care. Mr. Macneil was a Scotchman. The brogue of every country is
perhaps pleasing to the ear of sensibility, especially when it falls from the lips of a man of cultivation; it seems to assure us that simplicity and the
native features of mind have not been eradicated. With me the Scottish dialect is somewhat a favourite; it softens and mellows the sound of our island
tongue;
and the gravity which accompanies it, gives an air of sobriety and reflection to the speaker, which are particularly in accord with my serious disposition. It
reminds us of the fields, and not of cities. I thank you for your visit, said mr. Macneil, taking me by the hand. Your letter is a masterly picture of your character. I know not what you have heard of me
that made you desirous of seeing

me; but I suspect that I, rather than you, shall be the gainer by the intercourse. I am no humourist, nor misanthrope, though circumstances have obliged me to
be a little abrupt with some of the persons I have seen since I took up my residence here. I am a very plain man, and, if you expect any thing else, you will

be disappointed. I did not find mr. Macneil what I should have called a very plain man, yet I do not blame him for his assertion. It would be best of all, if every man knew
himself exactly for what he was, and announced himself accordingly. But this, alas! is impossible. Every one who does not think too humbly of his qualities,

sets too high a value upon them. And how ridiculous a thing is self-importance, a fancied sovereign demanding a tax from his imaginary subjects, which they
will never pay! False humility is indeed, if not a more ridiculous,

yet a more degrading error than arrogance. But every man who is aware of all the artifices of self-delusion, will rather set his demands below, than above, the
true rate. Among other subjects we talked of the character of Rousseau. Mr. Macneil expressed himself with a veneration and a tenderness toward this extraordinary man,
which I suppose were universally felt by all who approached him, except those who, thinking less of his weaknesses and the indulgence they demanded, than of

their own offended pride, finished by quarrelling with him. I saw much of Rousseau, said my host. He reposed many confidences in me. He often told me that he felt less suspicious and embarrassed with me, than with
almost any man he ever knew; and he asserted that the reason was, that I thought more of the subject discussed and the scene before me, and less of

how they would affect my own tranquillity and importance. I could see that one of his great misfortunes had been, that almost all his intimates were chosen
from among the French, that nation of egotists! Rousseau was a man of exquisite sensibility, and that sensibility had been insulted and trifled with in
innumerable instances, sometimes by the intolerance of priestcraft and power, sometimes by the wanton and ungenerous sports of men of letters. He lived
however, toward the close of his life, in a world of his own, and saw nothing as it really was; nor were his mistakes less gross, than if he had asserted
that
his little cottage was menaced by a besieging army, and assailed with a battery of cannon. Whether from the displeasing events that had befallen him, or from

any seeds of disease kneaded up in his original constitution, I was convinced, from a multitude of indications, that

Rousseau was not in his sober mind. How much are those persons mistaken, who imagine that a madman is necessarily incapable of composing orations as ardent as
those of Demosthenes, and odes as sublime as those of Pindar! How small a portion of the persons who, upon some topic or other, are unhinged in their
intellectual comprehension, is it necessary to place under corporal restraint!---Yet I was often led to doubt whether Rousseau, spite of the disease under
which he laboured, deserved upon the whole to be termed unfortunate. When he was induced to dwell for a time upon the universal combination which he believed

to be formed against him, he then undoubtedly suffered. But he had such resources in his own mind! He could so wholly abstract himself from this painful
contemplation; his vein of enthusiasm was so sublime; there was such a childlike simplicity often uppermost

in his carriage; his gaiety upon certain occasions was so good-humoured, sportive and unbroken! It was difficult to persuade myself that the person I saw at
such times, was the same as, at others, was beset with such horrible visions.--- Mr. Macneil related to me several curious anecdotes in support of these
observations. The wife of my new acquaintance was one of the most accomplished and prepossessing women I ever beheld. I have often remarked that this mixture and result of
the manners and habits of different countries, particularly in the female sex, presents something exquisitely fascinating and delightful. She was never
embarrassed, and never appeared to meditate how a thing was to be done, but did it with an ease, a simplicity, an unpretendingness, which threw every studied

grace into contempt in the comparison. She had been humbled by

the miscarriage of her early youth. But for this, her person and her accomplishments, the acknowledged sweetness of her temper and clearness of her
understanding, might perhaps have made her proud, and thus have tarnished the genuine lustre of her excellencies. The modesty with which she presented
herself
was inexpressibly engaging. There was a cast of the Magdalene in all she did; not of the desponding, not of a temper deserting its duties, unconscious of
recovered worth, or that invited insolence or contempt. It was a manner that had something in it of timidity, yet could scarcely be said to amount to
self-reproach; a manner indeed, that, by the way in which it confessed her frailty, made reproach, either by look or gesture, from any other, impossible. Her

failings had chastised in her pride of birth, and the assurance that superior attainments are apt to inspire, and had

generated that temperance, moderation and gentle firmness, which, wherever they are found, are the brightest ornaments of human nature. The young ladies, whose merits I had heard so highly extolled, were three. Each of these had principally devoted herself to some particular accomplishment, in
which, though not unskilled in other pursuits, she had made extraordinary progress. The eldest applied to the art of design; she drew, and even painted in
oil;
and her landscapes in particular had an excellence which, to speak moderately of them, reminded the beholder of the style of Claude Lorraine. The principal
apartment of the house was hung round with a series of the most striking scenes in the environs of the lakes, delineated by her pencil. The second daughter
had
chosen music for her favourite pursuit, and her execution, both on the piano forte and in singing,

was not inferior to that which her eldest sister had attained on canvas. The youngest was a gardener and botanist. She had laid out her father's grounds, and
the style in which they were disposed did the highest credit to her imagination. One side of the family sitting parlour was skirted with a green-house, of
the
same length as the room, and which seemed to make a part of it. This apartment was furnished with nearly every variety which Flora has ever produced in our
island, or which curiosity has imported, and were entirely cultivated by her hand. In her prosecution of the science of botany, she had also resorted to the

use of colours, and, though the employment she made of them was inferior in kind to the studies of the eldest, it is almost impossible to conceive any thing

superior to what she had reached, either in the

faithfulness of delineation, or the brilliancy of the tints. The names of these young ladies were Amelia, Barbara and Mary. The eldest had no pretensions to beauty, though there was an uncommon appearance of quick
conception and penetrating judgment in the various turns of her countenance. Barbara was a brunette. Her features were regular, her mouth was alluring, and
her
dark eyes flashed with meaning, and melted with tenderness. Mary had a complexion which, in point of fairness and transparency, could not be excelled. Her
blood absolutely spoke in her cheeks; the soft white of her hands and neck looked as if they would have melted away beneath your touch; her eyes were so
animated, and her whole physiognomy so sensitive, that it was scarcely possible to believe that a thought could pass in her

heart, which might not be read in her face. I never saw a family that excited in me so much approbation. Individuals I had encountered of great worth and extraordinary qualifications; but here was a
whole circle of persons, such as a man would wish to spend his life with: so much concord of affection, without any jarring passions; so much harmony of
interests, yet each member of the family having a different pursuit. To me, who was prone to regard the whole world with an eye of censoriousness and
displeasure, and who, having conceived this propensity, but too easily found materials to foster and nourish it, this was a ravishing spectacle. The father
so
well informed; the mother so interesting; the daughters so accomplished and so lovely! Mr. Macneil seemed to feel a kindness for me, proportioned to the
gratification I experienced in my visit; and, after

having pressed me to partake of their family-fare, proposed a ride along the shores of the Windermere the next morning. The day following was occupied in a
party on the lake; and thus by insensible degrees I became for a time almost an inmate in the family. I was so far advanced in life, as to preclude any idea
of
indecorum in my visits; and I addressed myself to the different members of the little commonwealth, as if I had been a brother to the master of the house,
and
an uncle to the daughters. I sat sometimes for hours by Amelia as she painted; I listened with unwearied attention to the lessons executed by Barbara: but my

chief pleasure was in attending the gentle and engaging Mary, in her morning visits to her flowers, and in her walks among the avenues which had been
constructed, and the bowers which had been planted, under her direction. Mr. Macneil was a man of the warmest philanthropy, and by degrees I reposed in him a confidence, to which I had seldom felt excited toward any other man. After
a time, I hired apartments in the house of a substantial farmer in his neighbourhood, that I might the more freely enjoy his conversation and acquaintance,
without being an interruption to the domestic economy of his family. I laid before him the secret grief that preyed upon my heart. I described the sickly
sensibility of my temper, the early disgust I had taken at the world, and the miserable sense of desolation which preyed upon my life, in my detached and
unconnected situation. Come, replied my friend, in that vein

of playful good-humour which he delighted to indulge,---whether you consult me, as a good Catholic does his priest, for the salvation of his soul, or as an
invalid does his physician for the restoration of his health, let us try if we cannot make a conversion or a cure of it! Many were the debates that passed between me and my host respecting the true estimate of the human species. We differed, I suppose first, because we had seen
them under unlike circumstances, and in unlike aspects. We differed secondly, because we compared them with different ideal standards. I thought, so to
express
myself, too highly of the human mind in the abstract, to be able to consider with patience man as he is. I dwelt upon the capacities of our nature, the
researches of a Newton, the elevation of a Milton, and the virtues of an Alfred; and, having filled my mind with

these, I contemplated even with horror, the ignorance, the brutality, the stupidity, the selfishness, and, as it appeared to me, the venality and profligacy,
in which millions and millions of my fellow-creatures are involved. I estimated mankind, with an eye to the goal which it is ardently to be desired they
might
reach; mr. Macneil estimated them, with an eye to the starting-post from which they commenced their career. "In every man that lives," he stoutly affirmed, "there is much to commend. Every man has in him the seeds of a good husband, a good father, and a sincere
friend. You will say perhaps, these are not sublime and magnificent virtues; yet, if each man were enabled to discharge these, the world upon the whole would

afford a ravishing spectacle. What a spirit of forbearance, of gentle attentions, of anxiety to maintain the cheerfulness and peace of his female companion,

inhabits every human breast! Scarcely do we hear of the monster in whom this spirit is ever extinguished. It accompanies almost all men, with whatever unhappy
interruptions, from maturity to the grave. Look upon the poorest clown in the midst of his children; what a heavenly picture! How do his eyes glisten at
their
little pleasures, their sallies of penetration and vivacity! How disinterested a sentiment burns in his heart! Yes, disinterested for I know you will laugh
at
the silly sophism, which, when it regards the immense sacrifices that every father is ready to make for his child, calls the impulse from which they spring a

selfish one. I acknowledge, I am weak enough to be as much delighted with the spectacle of the lively and ardent affection of an Englishman to his son, as if

it were directed toward the child of a Japonese. It is equally affection, and equally beneficent. How much good neighbourhood there is in the world! what readiness in every man to assist every stranger that comes in his way, if his carriage is broken down,
if his horse has run from and left him, or almost whatever is his distress! how cheerfully does he give his day's labour, or the produce of his day's labour,

to his friend, till that friend by injustice have proved himself unworthy of the kindness! For my part, instead of joining in the prevailing cry of the
selfishness, the wickedness, the original sin, or the subsequent depravity, of mankind, I feel my heart swell within me, when I recollect that I belong to a

species, almost every individual of which is endowed with angelic virtues. I am a philanthropist in the plain sense of the word. Wherever I see a man, I see

something to love,---not with a love of compassion, but a love of approbation. I need not put the question to him---I

know without asking, that he is fully prepared and eager to do a thousand virtuous acts, the moment the occasion is afforded him. "I have sometimes had the thought," continued mr. Macneil, "of composing a little novel or tale in illustration of my position. I would take such a man, as my
friend Fleetwood, for example, who looks with a disdainful eye upon his species, and has scarcely the patience to enter into discourse and intercourse with
any
one he meets: I would put him on board a ship; he will of course be sufficiently disgusted with every one of his companions: all of a sudden I would raise a

most furious tempest: I would cause him to be shipwrecked on a desert island, with no companion but one man, the most gross, perverse and stupid of the crew:

all the rest---the captain who, though sagacious, was positive, the surgeon who, though skilful, was tiresome

by his pedantry---I would without mercy send to the bottom. What do you think I would represent as the natural result of this situation? My fastidious
misanthrope would no longer have a world or a nation, from which to chuse his companion, and, after trying all, to reject all: he would be wholly deprived of

the power of choice. Here, sir, I would show how by degrees he would find a thousand resources in this despised sailor. He would find him active, spirited
and
alert. Where before he believed, without examination, that all was stupefaction, he would find by a variety of tokens, good sense and sagacity. How these two

companions would love one another! How they would occasionally spend the live-long night in delightful chat! How they would study each other's virtues and
attainments, even each other's foibles! With what eager anxiety, when any necessary occasion

separated them, would they look for each other's return! With what daring and superhuman courage would they defend each other from danger!--- And do not be
perverse enough to believe that all this anxiety would be the fruit of selfishness! They would have discovered in each other inestimable qualities, a large
stock of sound judgment and excellent sense, and an inexhaustible fund of kind and benevolent propensities. After some years I would bring back my
misanthrope
to England. Sir, he would never be able to part with his companion in the desert island. He would believe that there was not a creature in the world, take
him
for all in all, so valuable. Yet observe, he would only entertain this opinion of him, because he knew him more thoroughly than any of the rest of his
species. I took my sailor merely as a specimen of human nature, and of human

nature in one of its most unfavourable forms." I hope my reader will be convinced by the arguments of mr. Macneil. What a blessed state of mind was that, to which he appears to have attained! Yet, for
myself, I acknowledge, either because truth was on my side, or, it may be, merely from the excessive susceptibleness of my nature, or the accidents of my
life,
I remained unaltered by his discourses, and, though I wished to be a philanthropist, was a misanthrope still.



" What I have been yet saying," continued Macneil, "is speculation; let us now come to the most important part of my function, which is practice. Fleetwood,
you are too much alone. I hear people talk of the raptures of solitude; and with what tenderness of affection they can love a tree, a rivulet, or a mountain. Believe me, they are pretenders; they deceive themselves, or they seek, with their eyes open, to impose upon others. In addition to their trees and their
mountains, I will give them the whole brute creation; still it will not do. There is a principle in the heart of man, which demands the society of his like. He
that has no such society, is in a state but one degree removed

from insanity. He pines for an ear into which he might pour the story of his thoughts, for an eye that shall flash upon him with responsive intelligence, for a
face the lines of which shall talk to him in dumb, but eloquent discourse, for a heart that shall beat in unison with his own. If there is any thing in human

form that does not feel these wants, that thing is not to be counted in the file for a man; the form it bears is a deception, and the legend, Man, which you

read in its front, is a lie. Talk to me of rivers and mountains! I venerate the grand and beautiful exhibitions and shapes of nature, no man more; I delight
in
solitude; I could shut myself up in it for successive days. But I know, that Christ did not with more alacrity come out of the wilderness after his forty
days'
sequestration, than every man, at the end of a course of this sort, will seek for the interchange

of sentiments and language. The magnificence of nature, after a time, will produce much the same effect upon him, as if I were to set down a hungry man to a
sumptuous service of plate, where all that presented itself on every side was massy silver and burnished gold, but there was no food. "He is a wise physician, that knows how to prescribe for his own malady. Were the case you have described to me, the case of a bystander, you would immediately
see into its merits, as clearly as I do. You have no certain and regular pursuit; you have no equal alliances and connections. The miracle would be, if it
were
possible for you to be happy. You are too rich, to be able to engage with sincere eagerness in any undertaking or employment. The remedy therefore in your
case
must be derived from the other quarter. Marry! beget yourself a family of children! You are somewhat advanced in life; time must elapse before your children will be at an age to occupy much of your cares; if you feel any vacuity in the
interval, call about you your distant relations! Sit down every day at table with a circle of five or six persons, constituting your own domestic groupe. Enquire out the young men on the threshold of life, who, from the regulations of society, have the best claim upon your assistance. Call them round you;
contribute to their means; contribute to their improvement; consult with them as to the most promising adventure in which they can launch themselves on the
ocean of life. Depend upon it, you will not then feel a vacuity; your mind will no longer prey upon itself." I was some time before I could believe that my friend was in earnest.---"I, to entangle myself with a numerous family, whose temper was so fastidious and
sensitive

that I could scarcely chuse a companion for a day, that did not become in twenty ways disgusting and insupportable to me before the close of the day! "I, to marry! Had I not now passed the flower of my days in a state of celibacy? Whom was I to marry? I was near forty-five years of age. Was I to make what is
called a suitable match; that is, marry a woman of the same age as myself? Beside that there would then be small chance of offspring, I could not say I felt
in
myself much propensity to fall in love with a lady of this staid and matronly age. "Add to all this, I am impressed with no favourable prepossessions toward the female sex. I cannot be blind enough to credit what some have maintained,
probably more from the love of paradox than any other cause, that there is any parity between the sexes. Till the softer

sex has produced a Bacon, a Newton, a Homer, or a Shakespear, I never will believe it. Who does not see that the quickness and vivacity of their temper sets
them at an immense distance from profound sense, sublime feeling, and that grand species of adventure, which engrosses, from puberty to the grave, the whole

energies of the human soul? But, beside this, I think ill of their dispositions. The impressions of my adventures of gallantry in France I cannot overcome. Perhaps, in the tranquillity of sober discussion, you might bring me to confess that these impressions are unjust; but there they are; such are the
associations of my mind; I never can think seriously of a woman, still less propose her to myself as a companion, without calling to mind the marchioness de

L., and the countess of B. "I have another disqualification for marriage, worse even than this. I am

grown old in the habits of a bachelor. I can bear no restraint. You, sir, happy as you are in your family, must be fully aware, that it is impossible for two
persons to associate for a day, without some clash of their different inclinations. It is like hounds in a leash; the chain is upon their necks, and not upon

their wills. But we bear this wonderfully well for a time, because we see where it will end; most men bear it better than I do. But let the chain be such the

padlock of which cannot be unloosed, but by the death of one party or the other; Gods, how galling does it become! In an 'agreeable companion in a
post-chaise,' in the guest that visits, or the host that receives, me for a day, though his desires are absurd, though his manner be abrupt, and his
sentiments
dissimilar to my own, I am too proud to suffer my temper to be much ruffled by so fugitive an inconvenience. But how

trifles swell into importance, when the individual whose temper jars with mine, is to live with me for ever! Whatever offends me I feel as in the utmost degree
grave; every accidental difference preys upon my heart, and corrodes my vitals." Mr. Macneil laughed at the vehemence of my satire against marriage. "No," said he, "I do not absolutely insist, that you shall fix upon a lady of forty-five
years of age, or that you shall estimate her fitness to become your wife by the wrinkles in her brow. The man may love the wife at forty-five, whom, twenty
years before, he received a blushing virgin to his bed; habit may do much for him; a friendship has gradually sprung up between them, which death only is
powerful enough to dissolve; but this is not exactly the period at which the familiarity should commence. No; if you marry, Fleetwood,

chuse a girl, whom no disappointments have soured, and no misfortunes have bent to the earth; let her be lively, gay as the morning, and smiling as the day. If
your habits are somewhat rooted and obstinate, take care that there is no responsive stiffness in her, to jar and shock with. Let her be all pliancy,
accommodation and good-humour. Form her to your mind; educate her yourself. By thus grafting a young shoot upon your venerable trunk, you will obtain, as it

were, a new hold upon life. You will be another creature; new views, new desires, new thoughts, will rise within you. While you are anxious to please and
sympathise with your beauteous bride, you will feel as alert as a boy, and as free and rapid in your conceptions as a stripling. "You will tell me perhaps, that you could not make such a young creature happy. I differ from you in that. The

women are not like us in their tastes. A lady, as you say, past the meridian of life, will seldom be courted for a bride, unless with some sinister view; but
at least half the young girls you meet with, would be well contented with a husband considerably older than themselves. Man marries, because he desires a
lovely and soothing companion for his vacant hours; woman marries, because she feels the want of a protector, a guardian, a guide and an oracle, some one to

look up to with respect, and in whose judgment and direction she may securely confide. Besides, Fleetwood, you mistake yourself, if you think you are old. Your
visage is not wrinkled, and your hair is not grey. The activity of your temper, the many plans of life you have tried, your perpetual change of place, have
effectually preserved you from that running down of the wheels of fancy, that decay of the principle of life, which

should render you an unfit companion for a blooming bride. "You allege, that your temper, which is so fastidious and sensitive that you can seldom support the companion of a day, is a cause that would reduce you to
make an ill figure, in a domestic circle, with five or six individuals who sat down with you every day to table. Alas, Fleetwood, this is the very thing you

want, the cause why your temper is so blameably fastidious. The horse, however generous his blood, and graceful his limbs, who has never learned certain
paces,
and had his temper subdued to the intimations of the bridle, will never be victor in the race. Subject yourself to the law of associating with your
fellow-men,
place yourself in the situation to be the guardian and benefactor of your consort and kindred, and you will soon feel and bend to the necessity of consulting

their predilections as well as

your own. You will be a million times the better and the happier for it. "But the main error into which you have fallen, is to suppose that the way of living between a man and his wife, bears any resemblance to that with a
chance-companion in a post-chaise, or between an ordinary host and his guest. The first principle of society in this relation, if it is actuated with any
spirit of kindness, is the desire each party feels, to be the sacrifice of the other. Instead of regretting the unavoidable differences of inclination, they

become, where the topics to which they relate are not fundamental, an additional source of pleasure. Each party is eager to anticipate the desires of the
other, to smooth the way to their gratification, to provide for their happiness. If, between a pair thus kind and thus wise, any little debates chance to
arise, this too adds to their enjoyment. You know the proverb which says, The falling out of lovers is the renewal of love. Between man and man differences are gravely discussed and argumentatively
settled. Each revises the imaginary brief of his own cause, and becomes confirmed in his private view of the question at issue. But, between man and woman,
the
smile which unexpectedly displaces the clouded brow, is the symbol of peace. Arguments are thrust away by hundreds, like beggars from the facade of a palace. The party most in the right, mourns over this degrading advantage. The party most in the wrong, confesses the error incurred with so ingenuous a grace, as to

make error look as if it gave new improvement and finishing to a character.---Marry, Fleetwood! If you live, marry! You know nothing of happiness, if you do

not! You are as ignorant of the true

zest of human life, as the oak which at this moment overcanopies us with its branches!" Such were the advices of the intelligent and kind-hearted friend I had thus accidentally acquired. They made a strong impression upon me. I know not whether
the impression would have been so forcible, had the circumstances under which the advice was given been different. But the reader must recollect that it was

addressed to me in the midst of an amiable family, the children of which were daughters. While Macneil was earnest in describing the sort of wife he would
recommend to me, I thought of these accomplished young women: when we returned home from the walk or ride which these discussions had occupied, I looked
round
upon the circle, with different emotions from those which had previously accompanied the spectacle: could it be otherwise? I

have already said that the junior of the three particularly engaged my attention: I now caught myself repeatedly in my solitude uttering the involuntary
exclamation, "Mary, if ever I marry, it is thou that shalt be my bride!" The conversations between me and my host, the sense of which I have thus compressed, occupied many successive excursions. One day when Macneil was most deeply
engaged in the argument, I turned suddenly upon him, and cried out somewhat gaily, "Now, my friend, shall I try whether you are in earnest in all this
declamation? If such a marriage as you describe is desirable for me, it will be no less desirable for the woman I shall chuse; one of the parties in wedlock

cannot be happy alone. You say, I should chuse a young person, a person of pleasing manners, and a cultivated mind: where can I verify this description so
truly, as by your fire-side? Will you give me one of your daughters?" My friend paused. "A question like this compels one to be serious indeed.--- But---you have no grave meaning in proposing the interrogatory?" "I cannot tell. Your arguments have made me think: I do not say they have converted me. Macneil, I do not wish to trifle with you: if my question touches you
too nearly, I dispense you from a reply." "No; the question has been asked, and it shall be answered. Only, as I by no means wish to restrain you, by treating your question as a proposal, so I must
request you in return to consider my answer, as belonging merely to an abstract illustration, as a logical experiment to try the soundness of my
recommendation. I should be as much to blame in violating the modesty and maiden dignity of my children, as in imposing

fetters of any sort on the freedom of your deliberations." "Agreed! Nothing can be more reasonable." 'Well then; I have no objection to your person, your family, your fortune, your understanding, your accomplishments, not even to your age. But then as to your
temper,---
"Ay, there is the point!" "What a strange thing is advice! How difficult is it to put one's self exactly in the place of another? How hard, to be sure that the advice we give, is
exactly that which we should think reasonable, could we change persons with the man upon whom we are so ready to obtrude it? Fleetwood, I swear that I am
your
friend: I swear that the project I urged upon you, was urged in the sincerity of my heart." ---
" Io, triumphe ! I see, I shall die a bachelor!" ---Shall I confess my secret

weakness? My Io, triumphe , was uttered with a heavy heart. The lovely Mary had gained a station in my bosom, from which I felt I could with difficulty
dislodge her. "I love my children; you, all the world, would despise me if I did not. It is so difficult to judge for a child, conscious of unripened discernment, and
relying on my superior penetration and experience, or by whom, if this reliance is not placed, it clearly ought to be! I could cheerfully commit my own
happiness to the lottery of human affairs, but thus to dispose of the little all of one's daughter, is a fearful responsibility!---
"Yet, after all, this responsibility I must encounter. If my daughter marries a wise man or a fool, a prodigal or an economist, an honest man or a knave, and
it is done with my approbation, it must alike happen that I may

consider myself as the author of her happiness or her misery. "Well then, Fleetwood, I confess that the woman who marries you, will engage in a considerable risk. But, God knows, all marriage is a risk, is the deepest
game that can be played in this sublunary scene. You say true, that your risk will not be less, than that of the dame who accepts your hand. Yet I adhere to
my
advice, 'Marry!' or, which is indeed merely dressing that advice in another guise, 'Fleetwood, take the child of my bosom! win her partiality and kindness;
my
approbation waits on her preference!' "By this question however, which, as I said, I have answered merely under the notion of a logical experiment, you have brought to my recollection a part of the
subject, which, before, I ought not to have forgotten; and I thank you for it. If you should ever feel seriously disposed to adopt my recommendation, let it not be done lightly and unadvisedly. Consider it as the most important
transaction of your life. Consider that not merely your own happiness, but that of the woman who has consented to embark hers under your protection, the
virtue
and respectability of your possible offspring, and the peace of the venerable parents who have resigned her to your discretion, are at stake upon the due
regulation of your temper. Here indeed lies the great difference between your present condition, and that which I have been chalking out for you. Independent

and sole as you now stand, you find yourself answerable to none: you can discard your servants when you please; you can break off with your acquaintance; and

you need scarcely deign to ask yourself, Was I in fault? But you cannot so break off from the ties of

affinity and blood. Believe me, too much independence is not good for man. It conduces neither to his virtue, nor his happiness. The discipline which arises
out of the domestic charities, has an admirable tendency to make man, individually considered, what man ought to be. I do not think you, Fleetwood, worse
than
your neighbours. You are an honest and a just man, with sense enough to discern the right, and courage enough to pursue it. If you are now wayward and
peevish
and indolent and hypochondriacal, it is because you weakly hover on the outside of the pale of human society, instead of gallantly entering yourself in the
ranks, and becoming one in the great congregation of man." It was in such conversation that Macneil and I passed our time in our excursions on the banks of the Windermere. With what delight I recollect this happy
interval of my life! Ruffigny and Macneil

were the only two men I ever knew, the clearness of whose thinking was an ever fresh source of delight, and the generosity of whose souls, enlightening their
discourse, made their face occasionally look, as if it had been the face of an angel. But in the society of Macneil my happiness was even purer than in that
of
my father's friend. Ruffigny, gallant, noble-hearted mortal as he was, stood alone; my intercourse with him was a perpetual tï¿½te ï¿½ tï¿½te , and had too much of

monotony and uniformity for the unsatisfied cravings of the human mind; but to return home with Macneil, after a morning's temperate and sober discussion,
and
to see him surrounded with his blameless wife and accomplished daughters, what could the heart of man look for more? Add to which, I was occupied with the
new
sensations which agitated my bosom for the charming Mary. While I talked with her, I forgot

my prejudices against her sex; the marchioness de L. and the countess of B. seemed daily more and more to become the shadow of a dream; her conversation was so
inexpressibly ingenuous, and her sallies so artless, that, in spite of my preconceptions, she stole away my heart. Her delight was in flowers; and she seemed

like one of the beauties of her own parterre, soft and smooth and brilliant and fragrant and unsullied. Why did these days of yet unexperienced delight pass so quickly away! Mr. Macneil, before I knew him, had determined to pass over with his family to Italy,
with the intention of spending the remainder of his days there. He had a friend in the Milanese with whom he had contracted the strictest bonds of intimacy,

and who had often pressed him to take up his residence in his neighbourhood; he was promised that circle of female associates and acquaintance, which was
denied to mrs. Macneil in England; and this, though the admirable matron could have dispensed with it for herself without repining, he judged to be an
advantage of the first importance to his

daughters. Having formed a project of this sort, he had proceeded so far as to have settled to dispose of all his property in England, and to vest his fortune
in lands to be purchased on the spot of his destined abode. The affairs which related to this intended transplantation had already detained the family in
England longer than they wished; and I agreed to purchase the Westmorland estate, rather to facilitate the projects of my friend, than with any intention to

take up my residence in this part of the island. The property was transmitted, and lodged in the hands of a banker at Genoa; and mr. Macneil determined to
take
his passage by sea, from Falmouth for that city. The adventurers in this voyage were mr. Macneil, his wife, and his two eldest daughters; the youngest was to

remain, at least till the next season, upon a visit to a family, who in the

winter resided in London, and during the summer upon their estate in Gloucestershire. Every thing being prepared for the journey, the whole establishment removed from the Windermere, and set out for Falmouth, I myself, as well as the charming
cadette, making part of the escort. I shall not dwell upon the particulars of a tour, stretching almost from one extremity of the kingdom to another; we
reached the celebrated and commodious port from which my friends were to take their passage. Here we spent a period of seven or eight days, which was
rendered
so much the more interesting to me, as I knew not whether I should ever meet this amiable family again, and as it seemed to be at the mercy of the winds
whether almost every hour of our intercourse should be the last. The day after our arrival, Macneil

and myself took an excursion on the sea coast and among the cliffs, to explore the beauties of this delicious country. Previously to our quitting the borders
of the lakes, I had come to a more precise explanation with my friend, of the thoughts I entertained respecting his youngest daughter.
