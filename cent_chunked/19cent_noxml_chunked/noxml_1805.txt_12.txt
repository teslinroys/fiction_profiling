Have you? answered I, with a drooping and heavy voice, my powers blunted by the exhausting effects of all I had done and thought. Bless me, Fleetwood! you are not ill? ---And, saying this, she kissed my hand, drew a chair by my side, and soothed me with irresistible blandishments. What a state was mine! If she had not been thus consummately lovely, if she had not mollified me with so divine a grace, I should have known how to have
determined. The reader who has had experience

of the married life, will easily feel how many vexations a man stored up for himself, who felt so acutely these trivial thwartings and disappointments. Human
beings, who enter into the engagements of domestic life, should remember that, however man and wife may in interests and affections be one, yet no interests

and affections can prevent them from being in many respects distinct. No creature that lives can be always the same. Accidents of body or mind will
frequently
subvert the equilibrium of the system. Domestic avocations and cares will often call away the mind; and my wife will be thinking of the family linen or
plate,
when I want her to be thinking of the caverns of Pandemonium, or the retreats of the blessed. Even those observances of ceremonious life, which induce us to

listen to the story of a stranger with appearances of interest greater than the reality, or

which stimulate us to actual attention, cannot always be preserved between persons who live together in a style of equality. He who flies from all
contradiction, must dwell alone, or dwell with those to whom he never opens his soul. He who would reap the unspeakable joys of a social existence, must set

his account with a life of accommodation, in which both parties will have many things to sacrifice, many things to forgive, many things that will be sure to

keep their equanimity and good temper in exercise.---I can reason well upon these things now; but I bought my power of doing so at a very high price. At the close of a visiting-day, when we had had a full circle of the neighbouring gentry, Mary informed me, that she had been invited by the miss Philipses to
join them to a dance, which was to take place at Barmouth the day after tomorrow. And you have �ccepted the invitation? L�titia offered me tickets, and I have taken two. You will go with me, will not you? What time do you suppose you shall return home? About three or four in the morning. The moon will serve, and it will be a pleasant ride. Mary, did I never tell you my age? And what of that? You are not too old, I hope, for amusement, or for happiness? My dear love, I have formed inveterate habits, and outlived the age of experiments. I can neither figure in a country assembly, nor sit up with impunity till
four in the morning. Then, Fleetwood, if you will not go, neither will I. I desire no pleasures of which you are not a partaker. I will send John to-morrow morning, to carry back
the tickets. Oh, Mary, cried I, I see more and more that our tastes are different. It is very natural; you are young; you ought to have married a man nearer your own age. Do not let me stand in the way of your amusements! I had suffered much during the visit which was just concluded. My patience has been played upon beyond the extent

of my bearing. I was impressed with a sentiment approaching to despair.--- Mary did not at this moment comprehend the feelings which agitated me. If it will be more pleasing to you, resumed she, I will go by myself. And who do you expect will be your partner in the dance? L�titia has promised to get me a partner. There is the handsome mr. Mathews. As a new-comer, she told me, she dared say I might have him. Very well! very well! My dear love, what is it you would have? I wish you were married to mr. Matthews! Good God, Fleetwood, what have I done to deserve this unkindness?---And she burst into tears. I took her hand.---Do not weep, Mary! I beg your pardon. I am to blame. I try every way to please you, but in vain. I ask you for your company; you refuse it. I offer to stay at home; you reproach me with my youth. In the innocence
of my heart I name to you a gentleman as my partner, and you insult me. My dear parents! Is my happiness for ever sunk with you in the caverns of the ocean? As she spoke thus, I felt the bitterest self-reproach for what I had done. Yet she had touched me in a very tender point. Loving her as I did, I felt that she
must be every thing, or nothing, to me. I could not bear that my wife should have amusements for which I felt no partiality, least of all, amusements of
dissipation. I particularly felt an antipathy to this of dancing. I had not joined in recreation of that kind since my juvenile residence in France. And
there,
at least in the instances of which I had been a sharer, it seemed to me

incompatible with decorum or modesty. The eyes sparkled, the performers handled each other in a way that fired the blood, the wholsome restraints of sobriety
were banished, a species of electricity flowed from the joining fingers and meeting frames, and every thing seemed to beat an alarm to the ruder passions. I found in Mary a considerable degree of resentment, or, to speak more properly, a strong impression of sadness, ensuing on this little conversation. The next
morning at breakfast she rung the bell, and ordered that John should get ready to go with a message to mr. Philips's. The moment the servant had left the
room,
I went up to her, and said,
My love, I cannot bear to see you sad. Pray, oblige me, and go with the ladies to their assembly. Fleetwood, said she, do you think I regret the assembly? What have you ever

seen in me so frivolous, as to justify the imputation? No; it is not the trip to Barmouth, it is the unkind way in which you expressed yourself to me, that I
regret. I chose you from all the world. If you prove austere and unkind, what will become of me? You said, you wished me married to another: how many harsh
and
unfriendly thoughts are implied in that wish! I am hasty; I am irritable: you know my foibles. My dear girl will have many things to forgive in me; but I hope my errors, thus acknowledged, will only draw
us together the closer. Then do not, Fleetwood, let many of them be of this kind! Have pity on the poor orphan, who has no shelter but in you! I will be careful. But do not, Mary, lay any stress on such speeches as that of which you complain! The thought of not being yours never seriously entered

my mind. You are every thing to me. For your sake I am reconciled to the world. In you for the first time I feel that I belong to the great family of man, and
experience those delicious sensations which grow out of the charities we form for ourselves. Thank you, Fleetwood! And now who shall say, we are not happy? But, Mary,---but---there is one favour you must grant me. Name it! What can I refuse you? You must go to the assembly. Never. I see you have a strong objection to it, and that is enough. I wonder what possessed me, to think of it. It well suits a poor orphan as I am, to make
one in a dance. Fie, Mary! I shall never think you regard me as your whole family in one, if you always refuse to be gay. I am very angry with what I said to you about it last
night. It was harsh; it was cruel:

it was wicked. I shall not believe that you have forgiven me, unless you execute your original intention. We argued the point for some time; but at length I triumphed. In a high spirit of romance I determined to go with her, and even insisted that she should dance
with the young and handsome mr. Matthews, as miss Philips had proposed. Yet my objection to the recreation of dancing remained as strong in my breast as before. I thought that no modest single woman should dance with any partner
but her brother, or matron but with her husband. To witness this petty prostitution of my wife, was a penance I enjoined myself, for having so undeservedly
mortified and insulted her. One thought which occurred to my mind between the arrangement of this plan and its execution, I will mention,

to show how unreasonable and unjust I was prepared to be.---How came it, said I to myself, that Mary rung the bell in the breakfasting-room, to give her orders
for John to carry back the tickets? Might she not have done this in some way when I was not present? Does it not look, as if she designed that the giving
these
orders should produce a scene? If there was art in this, how deep and odious must be her art, and how egregiously am I her dupe! We went to Barmouth. It was impossible for man to entertain a greater detestation for the mummeries of a country-assembly than I did. How much had I already
suffered from the youthful and heedless disposition of my wife! I had lost the use of my own house, in the way I liked. I had attempted to call her attention

to the noblest objects of literature and refinement, and the attempt had only ended in my mortification. I

was involved in an endless series of visits with fox-hunting squires, and fat justices of the peace, their wives and daughters. Though I abhorred this sort of
company, I had not equanimity to retire to some obscure corner of the house, and pursue my own occupations, while they acted over their etiquettes and
decorums; nor indeed was this compatible with the complaisance I wished to show for my beloved.---But the worst was to come. I soon distinguished among the beaux of Merionethshire the handsome mr. Matthews. He was a man of family, had been well educated, and possessed an advantageous
air. He displayed, like some young noblemen I have seen, an easy assurance, which seems designed to put every one, less eminent in rank, or less captivating

than themselves, out of countenance. He was soon introduced to my wife, according to the arrangement

which had been settled. I stood at a little distance, and observed his debut . Mary was the most beautiful woman in the assembly, and accordingly mr. Matthews
appeared highly satisfied with his fortune. As they passed me, my wife slightly named me to her partner, who bowed; but I thought I could discover a
smothered
contempt in his air. When they had gone a little way, he looked back at me; I persuaded myself that he was saying to her, Is it possible such an old fellow
as
that, should be husband to so fine a young creature as you are? I could not avoid watching Mary and her partner during the dance. I observed that he was infinitely gallant and attentive to her. To my thought his countenance
proved that he was exceedingly struck with her figure and beauty. He omitted no exertion to appear amiable in her eyes. They were the

most graceful dancers, as well as the handsomest couple, in the room; and both entered with no little spirit into the amusement. I never saw Mary so
conspicuously alive; Matthews's demeanour, I believe, never absolutely overstepped the bounds of propriety; he was certainly exceedingly well-bred; yet many
of
his actions were strikingly free. They escaped being vulgar or offensive, by the airy and flying manner in which they were performed; so that, if a woman,
situated as Mary was, might in some instances have been startled, and felt prompted to complain, she would probably have been convinced by the little stress

which was laid on such advances, that all was meant in innocence. Matthews talked to her incessantly in every interval of the dance, and Mary seemed
sufficiently ready to sustain her part in the conversation. I was consummately miserable. Whenever

they talked with more than usual earnestness, I could not help believing that Matthews was exciting her to lament her condition, in being married to a man of
more than twice her own age. Every free and familiar action, every attention that this coxcomb paid to my wife, was a dagger to my heart. How beautiful,
exclaimed I to myself, were the manners, in this particular, of the ancient Greeks and Romans! How charming does Lucretia appear, spinning at midnight in the

midst of her maids, and Cornelia, surrounded with her children! Surely no wife ought to endeavour to make herself amiable and engaging in the eyes of any
other
man than her husband! When a marriageable girl allows herself, without fixed purpose, in sportive intercourse with a youth of her own age, we call her a
coquette; what epithet does the mistress of a family deserve, who acts in a similar manner? I felt all the torments of jealousy. How new to me were the sensations I experienced! I was in this sense a happy fellow, when I had no one's conduct to attend
to but my own, and, being a bachelor, was not called upon to be minutely scrupulous in that. Now my reputation---no, that was not the first object of my
care;
reputation was not the bread of my life,---my peace of mind---depended on the conduct of another. How wretched is the state of that man who is deceived in so

material a point, who presses to his heart the wanton partner of his bed, and believes her innocent; nay, who perhaps is habitually engaged in acts of
civility
to the coxcomb-serpent that stings him in the tenderest point! But, short of this, I could not bear that Mary should be weaned from me in any respect, or
find
amusement in the conversation of any man but myself. Perhaps this might lead her

by no slow progress to regret that we were ever united. I depended now for all that was dear to me upon the disposition of one who was young, gay, versatile,
and a woman. I watched over her, with the same sleepless anxiety with which a miser watches over his treasure: less happy in this, that his vigilance may be

expected to be effectual to his purposes, while the vigilance of a suspicious husband is essentially powerless, and often contributes to give existence to
the
evil, alienation of mind or perpetrated infidelity, which he fears. I had prided myself in the generosity of my conduct, in having insisted, that Mary should go to the assembly, that she should dance, that I would myself be her
escort, and that Matthews should be her partner. If I had yielded one of these points, it was by no means necessary that I should concede them all. There was

heroism in my determination;

but it was a heroism beyond the mettle of my spirit, and I ought not to have attempted it. At length this eternal evening drew to a conclusion. From the day of my birth to the present moment, I had never suffered so many hours of slavery. When we got
into the carriage to return, I felt irresistibly prompted to avenge my sorrows by inveighing against the neighbourhood, the evening, and the gay and elegant

dancer who had almost uninterruptedly engaged the attention of my wife. Poor Mary was in high spirits, and pleaded the cause adverse to mine in each of these

points. I must confess that I to a certain degree inveigled her into this hostility. I asked her opinion of every thing that had passed, and was tardy in
giving my own. She therefore frankly declared, that she was enchanted with our neighbours, who she thought were most amiable people, that Barmouth-assembly

was a ravishing scene, and that she had never met a more agreeable and well-behaved young man than mr. Matthews. When she had finished her panegyric, I echoed it with a deep groan. Mary started. My spirits had too long been pent up, and I now gave a loose to my speech. I
cursed the neighbourhood, and declared that country-assemblies were a device of the devil. I said that such young men as mr. Matthews, answered no mortal
purpose but to disturb the peace of families. The conversation they held was seduction, their attentions were lime-twigs to entrap the unwary, and their
touch
was contamination. Oh, Mary, cried I, in a tone of heartfelt anguish, did I ever think it would come to this? Ought you not well to have reflected, before you accepted the hand
of Fleetwood, whether your taste led you, in preference to the sobriety of

a domestic fire-side, to dances and assemblies, the society of giggling girls, and the gallantries of a coxcomb? What prospect can we have of peace and
felicity, when you have now declared your partiality for those things, which are equally abhorrent to my personal habits, and irreconcileable to my period of

life? Mary burst into tears. My dear love, said she, you in this instance, and not mr. Matthews, are my seducer. Did not I at the first word give up my engagement; and did not you insist
that I should adhere to it at all points? When you obliged me to go to this assembly, and to dance with the young gentleman who has been my partner, you, in

all reason, engaged that you would not put yourself in ill humour with that which your own decree imposed upon me. This is evasion, Mary. When I insisted that you should go, I did not include

in my demand, that your partner should be so insidious and persevering in his siege, that you should encourage him to still greater boldness, or that you
should afterward become his advocate and eulogist. If your sentiments had been pure, instead of the delight you take in the bare recollection of Matthews,
you
would not endure so much as to hear him named. Conversation like this occupied us during a part of our ride home, which afterward subsided into a somewhat sullen silence. The next morning at breakfast, I
revived the subject. Mary, said I, have you thought of the incidents of yester-evening? My heart bleeds, while I recollect it. It has been the incessant occupation on my
thoughts. Fleetwood, we might be happy, if you were consistent. Tell me the habits of life you wish me to pursue, and I will exert my utmost efforts to conform to your
will. Mary, we might be happy, if you were consistent. I do not desire you to conform to any system of my prescribing. I want the heart, and not an exterior pliableness. Alas! my love, let me assure you that you do not know what you want. I am young. Fleetwood, you might have married an old woman, if you had pleased. I have
somewhat, yet I think no inordinate share, of the gaiety and spirits incident to youth. Yet I am very sure that my sallies are perfectly innocent. Oh, yes, madam; exceedingly innocent, to encourage such an enterprising young fellow as Matthews, and to find an extacy of delight in that scene which was
tearing your poor husband's heart into a thousand pieces! Fleetwood, you oblige me to tell you that I have very little encouragement to become a dutiful and attentive wife, when, with the unreserved conformity I use,
I find it impossible to please you. Very well, madam! very well!---And I left the room. My character by this time is sufficiently manifest; I was to the last degree impatient of contradiction. Mary had shown herself an exemplary wife; if there was
any sharpness in what she said, it was no more than is inseparable from the clear and open temper of an honourable mind. She was conscious of the entireness
of
her duty, and the disinterested sentiment which animated her; and it is no wonder, that she felt some indignation at the ungracious way in which all this was

received. There is not a word that she uttered, which now, as I write it down, I do not approve. She might have courted me more, and have abstained from
every
thing that could increase the exacerbation of my spirit. But, if she had, she would not have been more successful. Every thing I saw and felt at this time was so new to me! I had scarcely ever

been checked by my tutor or by my father. Since I grew up to man's estate, the system of my domestic life had been with servants only, where every thing was
done in uncontending obedience. The acuteness of my feelings had prevented me from being tyrannical and severe to my dependents; but, if my government was
mild, it was not the less absolute. Now I lived for the first time familiarly, every day, and all day long, with a person claiming to have a will of her own;

with one, who in every thing she was expected to do, had a right to have her feelings consulted, and was surrounded with privileges of a very different stamp

from those of a servant; and, which is perhaps of more importance, with one, whose feelings made the principal part of the question, and respecting whom it
was
of less moment what she did, than with what temper

every thing she did or suffered, was sustained. Unused, as I have said, to encounter the smallest obstacle to my will, or to have any of my decisions replied to, I felt the utmost impatience at those gentle
manifestations of independence, which, to a man inured to better habits, would have made the person in whom they appeared a thousand times more lovely. The
irritation I expressed was softness and conciliation to what I felt. The words I uttered were nerveless, compared with the tone in which they were spoken,
and
the gestures that accompanied them. My eyes flashed fire; my teeth ground against each other. When I burst out of the room thus abruptly, chains of steel and

rocks of adamant could scarcely have withheld me. The scene I have related was hardly over, when mr. Matthews rode up to my

door, to pay his respects to his partner of the preceding evening. This circumstance had not been expected; and, in the remote situation in which we lived,
strict regulations are not inforced, as in the metropolis, respecting what visitors are to be let in, and what to be excluded. Mr. Matthews was shown into a

parlour; the servant went to seek my wife. It so happened that Mary, who had been in the garden to visit the favourites of her care, entered the parlour by
another door, before she was informed that mr. Matthews was there: otherwise, after what had just passed between us, she would most assuredly have excused
herself from seeing him. She was going to retire, but she felt that that was impossible; and therefore, with much uneasiness and perplexity, entered into
conversation with him. When I had left my wife, I strayed into a well-known path, which led toward

the sea-side. At first I felt in the highest degree irritated against her behaviour. What chance, said I, have we for happiness, if, supposing me to be in the
wrong,---it is impossible I should be wrong!---she, instead of soothing my weakness, thus answers me with taunting and retort? Soon however I came to see the subject in a different light. Fleetwood! Fleetwood! said I, striking my forehead with my hand, what is it you are doing? I have
entered upon a serious and weighty task, the guardianship of the felicity of a young woman, who, without reserve, or defence, or refuge against me, has
thrown
herself into my power. What engagements did I form to her father; with how solemn protestations did I undertake to remove all uncertainty from his mind! Macneil! death has given to these engagements and added sacredness: thy ghost shall be

appeased!---Look upon this young creature! Soft, and tender, and winning as she is, shall I be her destroyer? Do I doubt her innocence? Truth and honour are
written in her front, in characters which folly itself cannot mistake. Was ever conduct more exemplary? Was ever temper more generous and obliging? What a
brute then am I, to misuse, and give uneasiness to so much excellence! I will throw myself at her feet, and with tears of anguish confess to her my fault. Full of these sentiments of remorse, I hastened back by the way I came, and entered the house. As I approached the parlour, and had my hand on the lock of the
door, suddenly my ears were saluted from within with a burst of idle and obstreperous laughter. I was in the highest degree astonished. I instantly turned
back, and enquired of the servants into the cause of this phenomenon. I no sooner heard from whom it

proceeded, than all my good resolutions vanished in a moment. In the disturbed state of my thoughts, it seemed to me that the visit of Matthews was an express
declaration of war against me; and, unacquainted as I was with the circumstances which had betrayed Mary into the admission of his visit, I regarded the
scene
now going on, after what had just passed, as the most atrocious of crimes. I wished that my wife had embarked with the rest of her family, and were sunk in
the
caverns of the ocean. I wished that her name might never again be pronounced in my ears. I ordered my horse to be instantly prepared. Whither was I going? I could not tell. For how long a time did I purpose to be absent? I knew not. I only knew that all places were paradise compared with that
in which I was, and all modes of thinking heaven compared with the reflection that Matthews

was at this moment alone with my wife. Before my horse was brought to the door, I began however to ask myself, whether it became me thus to go away, and leave my wife in undisturbed conversation
with her paramour. Incensed with this idea, I suddenly altered my plan, and burst into the parlour. Both my step and my countenance were extremely
discomposed. My wife, conscious how strange an appearance this visit would have, was greatly embarrassed. Matthews remarked the fierceness of my demeanour, and distinctly
read what was passing in my mind; but, like a man who knew the world, he assumed a more courtly and ingenuous air, in proportion as he saw I was enraged
against him. He was aware that, if he gave the least encouragement to my passions, they would produce a scene. But this neither suited

him, as a gentleman, nor as a man of the world. His character for insinuation and good-breeding was at stake, that he should appease the vehemence of my
feelings, without seeming to notice them. He played his part in a masterly manner. At first my answers were short, and sullen, and in a style approaching to

defiance. He was upon the alert to avoid every topic, which could, by any chance-direction, strike a spark into the train that was ready laid in my bosom. He

praised my house, and the prospect it commanded. He observed, that he had heard I was a great traveller: he had himself lately returned from Paris; and he
described the barriers which had been erected, with some other alterations which had recently been made there. By degrees I recovered my self-possession. Mr.

Matthews delivered about a dozen remarks of nearly the same degree of importance, but uttered with

spriteliness and grace, and then took his leave. As soon as he was gone, Mary informed me in the simplest and most ingenuous terms, how she had been betrayed into the receiving his visit. The story was so
natural; her countenance, as she spoke, was so sweet and engaging; she was evidently so much distressed at the effect she feared this mal-encontre would
produce upon me! I could not altogether resist the force of these demonstrations. I said little; but I withdrew, that I might seriously take myself to task
for
the weakness, into which I saw I was falling. Fleetwood, said I, is it possible thou shouldst commit such egregious folly? What ground hast thou for this outrageous and frantic jealousy? What has passed,
what can have passed, between Matthews and thy wife? Is she not the most innocent and affectionate of her

sex?---I am myself the most fortunate of men. After having trifled away the flower of my age, and conceived so strong an antipathy to the sex, have I not met
with the best of wives, a creature who, for beauty, for accomplishments, for gentleness and tenderness, has not her equal on the face of the earth? I am old:

what matters that? She does not see it; she does not impute to me an imperfection. Flower of creation, most angelic, noblest of mortals, thou shalt be
rewarded! Yes, if it is in my power, thou shalt be rewarded! Would to God, I had always continued in this temper! But I was subject to perpetual relapses. Every thing that thwarted and crossed me, still produced in me
new displeasure against this charming woman. She was like the angel, appointed by heaven to defend my steps; and, whatever circumstance of a painful nature
occurred to me, still

seemed to be chargeable upon some neglect of hers. I suffered from visits and visitors; I felt myself restrained in going out and coming in; the liveliness of
Mary's temper, and the quickness of her perceptions, made her, in spite of her gentleness, unfit for the curb; a thousand times, when I wished to fix her
attention to a particular point, and when I had worked up my whole soul with the imagination of it, she was drawn aside by some new fantasy, and left
abruptly
the pursuit, the lecture, and the professor: all these evils came to me from my wife. It is human nature, that a man should retain some resentment against the instrument that has often wounded him, however valuable the instrument may be, and
however innocent of any purpose to harm. The man, who has repeatedly crossed me in my desires, and has constantly stepped before me in the objects

of life, it is morally impossible I should not come to consider as a bad man. It was thus with Mary. Every time she did any thing that jarred with my
propensities, and by some accident or other no day passed without something, greater or smaller, of this kind, my favourite theory about the female sex
revived; I recurred to the bitter experience of my youth; and swore that, however it might in certain instances be glossed over, all women were in the main
alike, selfish, frivolous, inconstant and deceitful. It was a strange war that was continually going on in my bosom. I doted on my wife to distraction; I felt that I could not exist without her; I saw that she
was every thing that was lovely; her tones penetrated my soul; her smiles drew me from my most stedfast purposes, and made me as ductile as wax to the aims
she
proposed. Yet I taught

myself gradually to curse this as weakness, and to regard it as a slavery which some devilish witchcraft had fastened on my heart. I murmured at my way of
life; I roared like a lion in the toils. My whole existence was tempestuous. At certain moments, when Mary directed against me all her powers of fascination,
I
felt the joys of heaven; at other times, and these were of longer duration, I suffered the torments of the damned. The month of September came, and with September that variable weather, which ordinarily marks the period of the equinox. At this time a sensible change
discovered itself in the health of my wife. Her appetite left her; her nights were sleepless; she became languid, and meagre. I was deeply affected with the

alteration I perceived; I was beset with the fear that my unkindness was the occasion of what I saw. Alas, Mary, said I, you wanted a very different treatment from that which you have received from me! All tender and gentle you are in your own nature; all
tenderness and gentleness ought to have been the behaviour that was addressed to you. With mildness and benignity

were you brought up by the best of fathers and of mothers; I myself have witnessed their affection; often have I heard you describe it. It was not fit you
should fall from the hands of these kind guardians, into those of a husband, harsh, severe and capricious as I have been. She has suffered the most terrible
of
all losses; she thought to find a refuge from calamity and a compensation for her sufferings in me; was it right that I should have been the person to
aggravate her woes? She cheerfully resigned the prerogative and the preference of her sex and age, the marrying a young man in the bloom of life, with the
wholsome hue of youth in his cheeks, with a smooth and unfurrowed brow, not yet enslaved to peculiar and unaccommodating habits, with a warm imagination, and
a
fresh and unsated relish of the various pleasures of existence. Ought I not to have done every thing

that my mature period of life would admit, to lessen to her the sacrifice she had made? Mary saw the anxiety and remorse under which I laboured. She exerted herself, to the utmost of her power, to relieve them. She dressed her pallid countenance
in smiles; they were the smiles of a winter's day, when the sun sends forth a sickly beam amidst watery and congregated clouds. She protested, she was happy;

she solemnly assured me that she thought my conduct toward her immaculate. I caught her repeatedly in tears. I endeavoured to tempt her with parties of
pleasure. With very different feelings from those I have formerly described, I called the Philipses and the Morgans around me. She refused these avocations
as
often as she could. When compelled to accept them, she sat passive and joyless amidst the youthful circle, except at moments when

she perceived my eye turned inquisitively upon her, and then she forced an artificial animation, which quickly again subsided into cureless dejection. I
enquired after another country-assembly; I wished for Mr. Matthews again to waken her into enjoyment. When I proposed tickets to her, she smiled
significantly
in my face; but added, that it would not do. What a life is this? said I. What a life for me, who have ever led my days free from dependence or restraint? Am I converted into a garde-malade , having for
my constant occupation to watch the symptoms of another? Are my sensations, to which I have so long been a slave, to pass unheeded and as nothing? Is all my

happiness, my peace of mind through every successive moment, to depend, not merely on the good pleasure and complacence of another, but on the state of that

persons pulse, or the clouds

which may accidentally hover over her diseased fancy? Yet I call heaven to witness that, however I occasionally murmured under a system of life so opposite to that to which I had been accustomed, my love for my
wife was no wise diminished. The more she wanted my aid, the more eager I was to afford it. The more she fell away from the healthful sleekness of a
beautiful
woman, the more she appeared to me like an angel. If it was but seldom that she could rouse herself to an entire interchange of affectionate thoughts, these

intervals became as transporting as they were rare. I could patiently watch through a month of eclipse, to be rewarded at last with a sight of the God of my

idolatry. The mother who rears a sickly and perishing child, is always found to love that child better than her robust and comely one; her own

labour has become kneaded up in the little being before her; he seems the creation of her hands, continually dependent for his existence on her breath. It was
thus I felt toward Mary. She in return became more affectionate than ever; she was sensible of my cares, and eager to acknowledge them. I firmly believe that I am the most capricious and way ward being that ever existed. I never remained permanently in one state of mind.
