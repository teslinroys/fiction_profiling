Disease and casualty attend
Our footsteps, to the journey's end. COOPER's Poetical Blossoms. MR. HARRINGTON was, within a few weeks after the departure of his uncle,
established in all honey-moon happiness, at his wife's cottage orn�e. Margaret, with no
one adventure, or prospect of any thing of the kind, (for she had given up the expectation
of Sir Charles coming about the farm in various disguises, and had strictly examined the
features of every masculine-looking female gleaner in vain,) now passed the unchequered
routine of her dreary hours in tears, spleen, and ill-humour, and was but a poor substitute
for her sister in the management of household affairs. The reign of romantic solitude was past, and she had no more delicious romances
from Lady Isabella, to cast their sweet illusive principles over her gloomy hours. She
again had recourse to the library, but her taste had become too vitiated to find
entertainment in the domestic novels of a RICHARDSON, or a MISS BURNEY: the new
publications, teeming with scandalous anecdotes of known characters*, under fictitious
names, were, as yet, unexplored by her; and if they had been, could not be either
entertaining or interesting, as the parties were unknown to her; neither had they found
their way to the receptacle of novels, from whence she drew the chief sources of her
leisure amusements. Again she essayed the charms of old romance and legendary tales: very, very
eventful had been the scenes she had witnessed within the last two months of her life; but
yet they had nothing in them which could remind her of towers, the dungeons of ancient
castles, or hitherto-undiscovered parchments found amongst mouldering ruins; and she
read over a few pages of these once-dearly-cherished works, and turned from them in
disgust; while she deemed herself too good an historian to re-peruse historic romances,
which, though doubtful facts were enveloped in thick clouds of fiction, she fancied were
all literally true. *
But, one evening, the poor, despised, and almost forgotten Phelim O'Gurphy
awakened her late sleeping lethargies to the marvellous and romantic. He was sitting on a
bench, under a window at which she sat reclining in pensive mood; when the voice, and
*Particularly the libellous trash of Eth-g-on, the author of "A WINTER IN DUBLIN," &c.
*This may with propriety be termed Historique, since every one must acknowledge that it is true. in particular, the words of Phelim, addressed to his fellow-servant, arrested all her
attention: "Botheration; cannot you be after understanding me? why your head is as thick
as mush! I tell you over and over again, for the first time, as I did before, that every
mother's son in Ireland, that has his name beginning win an O or a Mac, are all come
from the kings of Ireland!" Margaret now began to think that she had not been wrong in the first ideas she had
formed of the nobility of Phelim, especially when she heard his indignation at the rude
laugh he had extorted by this assertion from the English clown, and who said to the
Hibernian, "Soa, you would fain make un believe, that you bees the son of a king! by
goles, and you'd make a rum sort of a prince!" "Arrah! and why not?" said Phelim, in great wrath; "I'd have you to know, that I
was born to as good a property as any lad in Ireland; but he who owned it, would never let
my poor mother have so much as a potatoe belonging to it; and, to be sure, my mother,
was not she an O'Hagglety, and my own father an O'Gurphy? and every body in
Tipperary knows the O'Haggleties is a good a family as ever tasted potatoes and
buttermilk: but now I will be after telling you all about it: my uncle O'Hagglety, my
mother's own brother, he married a woman of the name of Mac-Alister; and och, to be
sure, was not she a pretty nut to crack under the devil's tooth? "-"I do'ant know," says
the clown, "any thing about she. "-"Aye, by my soul, but I do," continued O'Gurphy. "Well, my dear honey, what does she do, but claim a relationship! saying, she was the
fifth cousin to our seventh cousin, who enjoyed the* property till it should come to our
turn to have it: he was a Mac-Alister; but I believe her name, if she had spake truth, had
no Mac to it, but it was Mulcalister; she, och, the devil burn her, has got the best part of
the property now, because of her name, and being the fifth instead of the seventh cousin:
so poor Phelim is obliged to work for his living. Arrah, and what should I have done, if I
had not found such a good master? Here's God bless him, and long life to him! By the
holy St. Patrick, and you've emptied the mug while I have been talking to you!" Margaret had heard enough; she rose and walked from the window; while her
reflections crowded one after the other in quick succession: "Ah!" thought she, "I knew I
could not be mistaken in my ideas of his former grandeur; he is higher even than I
thought: I imagined him only to have been a nobleman, but I find him in reality a prince! descended from the most ancient kings of Ireland! Oh! false Sir Charles, perhaps I shall
one day triumph over you, when the wicked usurper, Lady Mulcalister will be obliged to
deliver up the immense riches and extensive domains, which she now withholds from this
lovely youth, their rightful lord!" After that moment, which had convinced her of Phelim's dignity, she never
requested him to perform any menial office; though, from the time she had imagined him,
according to Mrs. Kennedy's predictions, a very low fellow, she had not only behaved to
him with haughtiness and contempt, but had always called upon him to do every species
of drudgery about the house, and the good-nature and diligence with which he had obeyed
her commands she now construed into proofs of his extreme love towards her. She actually shed tears at her former cruelty, and would willingly have waited on
him herself, if shame had not deterred her: his assiduity, however, when he has seen her
*The lower class of Irish are all uncommonly fond of claiming relationship, and talking of their property,
though often only in the clouds. perhaps at the pump, filling a pitcher of water for herself, and which has made him run
eagerly to fill it for her, she was sure proceeded from the patient ardour of his affections,
and she regarded Phelim O'Gurphy with more admiration than ever. Happy in the ideal possession of the heart of this hero in disguise, she again
applied her solitary hours to reading, but the ghosts, the witches, the spacious corridors,
mouldering castles and dungeons, since the pig-stye adventure, had lost their delusive
charms. In her father's library was the excellent novel of GIL BLAS; she there found the
affecting history of a young cavalier, disguised as a gardener, on the estate of him who
was married to his wife, while he, the former husband, had been reported to have been
slain in battle. The interesting romance of ZA�DE also, and some other Turkish tales,
shewed her how frequent were such transformations; her romantic mind told her how
probable were such adventures, and Phelim, therefore, was again re-instated in her heart's
opinion, on firmer grounds than ever. Mr. Marsham had gone that day, when she had heard Phelim relate the grandeur
of his descent, to dine with some members of a fox-chase society, and this annual dinner
generally kept him to a late hour. Margaret and her father had dined t�te-�-t�te, and in the
evening walked over to the cottage, to see the new-married couple. Frederic Harrington
left his home, only to take a few very quiet morning airings at a gentle pace, in his postchaise,
on account of his yet unhealed wound; and he still continued in a delicate state of
health, though gaining strength every day. He was, as yet, delighted with his charming Mary; but as his health amended, he
began to feel a sameness in his way of life, which convinced him he could never endure
such a monotony, however agreeable, to continue always: and though with eagerness he
had once expressed his wishes that his Mary should have a music-master, and other
masters to teach her a few polite accomplishments, that he might shew her off the ensuing
winter in town to advantage; yet, a faint emotion of surprise, and almost self-reproof,
sometimes, though not often, arose in his mind, to think that he should have been so very
infatuated, as to make a girl his wife, who could not play with spirit at every genteel game
at cards; could not, he was sure, delight in the charming midnight squeeze of a crowded
London rout, nor be quite at home in the gay and splendid scenes of continual and
confirmed dissipation. These symptoms of regret were very faint indeed; and, as has been remarked
before, very seldom arose in his breast; but that they did arise, is certain: and when Mary,
at such moments, delighted at the thoughts of learning music, has exprest that delight, and
asked when she was to begin? he has said, "Well, stay till we get to London; though I do
really think you are too old to learn now." Then his sudden return of fondness, as he
regarded the varying attractions of her animated and intelligent countenance, the
sweetness of her bewitching smile, and reflected on the excellency of her heart and
disposition, he has quickly thought within himself, Oh! such an angelic being must confer
honour on any situation; and then impulsively catching her to his bosom, he has said,
"Your sweet voice, my charming girl, depend upon it, shall be quickly cultivated, that you
may know how to sing to music, when any one may accompany you, and with proper
expression." Edward Marsham, as yet, perceived no change in the mutual happiness of the
young people: it was indeed too early a day for him to imbibe such an idea, and Mary had
really suffered no diminution of her felicity; for at present her Frederic was all tenderness,
politeness, and attention. Margaret longed for such a state of bliss as she saw her sister enjoy; and yet
Margaret, with all her folly, could not associate Phelim O'Gurphy in those ideas. She had passed, as well as her father, a delightful evening, and Edward went home
completely happy in the felicity of his children. Frederic revered and loved his father-inlaw,
and the pleasure his society ever afforded to this in many other respects wavering
young man, always rendered him doubly kind to his dear Mary: and the worthy Curate,
joyful in the conjugal bliss of his dearest daughter, walked home in fervent gratitude to
heaven, his heart overflowing with satisfaction, and his eye glistening with the tear of
thankfulness to the Supreme Dispenser of good. Edward and his daughter had not long been at home, when, as they were
expressing their surprise at the lateness of the hour, and that Ralph had not yet returned,
both saying almost at the same time, "I knew he would not be early, but I never knew him
so late before;" a loud ringing at the front gate rather alarmed them, for it was always the
custom of Ralph to take his horse round to the stable-yard, and come in himself at the
door which led to the back part of the house: Phelim, however, who had sat up for him,
went quickly to the gate, and as quickly returned, with a countenance as pale as death,
and scarcely able to articulate, "Oh! sir, for the love of J--s come! oh! my poor
master!" Margaret, not knowing what she did, and now feeling, for the first time, that she
really loved her rustic uncle, rushed with her father to the front garden; there a most
piteous sight presented itself to their horror-struck eyes, two men were bearing in their
arms the almost lifeless and bleeding remains of Mr. Ralph Marsham! for his collar-bone
was broken in two places, his arm also broken, and his body almost dashed to pieces. The strides of death were too rapid and hasty for any medical art to arrest; speech
returned no more, though sense did not seem utterly fled, for he essayed to lift his
unbroken arm, and his finger appeared to point, and his eye to glance towards an old
escritoire, which stood in his bedroom, and in a few minutes after he was laid on his bed,
he resigned his spirit into the hands of his Creator. Had the action of pointing to an old worm-eaten escritoire been performed at any
other moment, what food for adventure would it not have been to Margaret! But wholly
absorbed in the agonising scene before them, she sank, bitterly weeping, on her poor
uncle's shattered body, and soon, in a fainting fit, was carried senseless out of the
chamber. The two men who had borne in his body were next attended to; one appeared the
perfect gentleman, though dressed in the equalising costume of a modern protector of the
noble art of pugilism; and he explained to the Reverend Mr. Marsham the dreadful
catastrophe. In going down an hill, the horse of Mr. Ralph Marsham had started at a cow
which was grazing in a neighbouring meadow: the hill being very steep, and Mr.
Marsham knowing that the horse had always been accustomed to start at black cattle,
made him turn the creature round; in turning, he went too close to the side of the


declivity, and fell from a perpendicular height of several feet, with the whole weight of
the horse falling upon him. The gentleman who had been supping at an house in the vicinity, was walking
home, accompanied by his servant, and they witnessed all the horror of the fatal accident,
without having it in their power to prevent it: the horse had fled, and they bore the
miserably lacerated man home between them. From a direction they found on a letter in
his pocket, and which they had made out by the light of the moon, they discovered the
dwelling of the unhappy man, and conveyed him to his sorrowing survivors. Edward intreated to know to whom he was obliged for this mournful, yet friendly
office; and found the gentleman was a man of immense fortune who resided chiefly in
London, a Mr. Davenport. He was then on a visit with his lady, in the country; and this Mrs. Davenport was
formerly a Miss Maddison, who, though some years younger than the late Mrs. Edward
Marsham, had been her most particular friend. Mr. Davenport promised to call on Edward
before he quitted the country, which he expected would be very soon, and wishing him a
good-night, Edward repaired to the chamber of his departed brother, to weep over his
shattered remains. In the morning, he recollected the escritoire, and taking the keys of the deceased,
he there found his will; but what particularly excited his astonishment, and added to his
affliction, on account of poor Margaret, to whom he now found he had nothing to
bequeathe, was the following clause in Ralph's last will and testament:
"And, whereas, in my days of early youth and indiscretion, I particularly attached
myself to a young woman of the name of Jane Matthews, of the parish of St. John's, in
the village of Frelingham, in the county of Suffolk, and by whom I had a son; I therefore
give and bequeath to this my natural child, Matthew Marsham, excepting one hundred
pounds sterling to each of my nieces, all my personal property and furniture, together with
the farm, and farm-land of Eglantine; which said farm was left to me by my late father
Joseph Marsham, to be entirely at my future disposal, as his will shall certify.-Jane
Matthews has now been dead some years; my son Matthew Marsham was brought up to
the chirurgical profession, and was appointed surgeon to one of his Majesty's West-India
corps; and has been returned about two years to England: his agents, Messrs.---and
---, will certify whether he is living, and where he may be found." Poor Edward was left now with his sixty pounds per annum, which he received
for his cure, and his share of a small life-annuity, with his brothers, made his annual
income little more than eighty pounds: he lifted his eyes to heaven, in humble submission
to the decrees of Providence, while they streamed with the mingled tears of regret, at the
loss of his worthy brother, and at the idea of his daughter's indigence. He immediately dispatched a letter to the rightful heir; and a visit of condolence
from Mr. and Mrs. Davenport, put a period, for the present, to his mournful reflections. Why do we pluck all the flowers in Spring? Winter
is niggardly with flowers, and the few that do spring up,
smell but faintly. Therefore these few should be planted
early, and raised with care. KOTZEBUE. MRS. DAVENPORT advanced with much polite sweetness to meet the embrace
of her worthy clerical friend; and hearing from him, during the course of her visit, of the
state in which Mr. Marsham had left his affairs, she requested to have the happiness of
taking Miss Marsham to town with her the ensuing week; offered her her protection, and
promised, in every respect, to consider her, and treat her, as her own child. Mrs. Davenport had no children; the offer was too advantageous for the Curate to
refuse, and he joyfully acquiesced in the warmly-expressed wishes of such disinterested
benevolence: he had known Emily Maddison a most charming and unassuming girl;
generosity of disposition amounted almost, in her, to a fault; but it was an amiable one,
and Edward now rejoiced that she had married a man, whose immense fortune, and their
having been married eleven years without any prospect of a family, rendered that profuse
liberality no longer a fault, but rather a virtue. Edward Marsham had yet to learn, that Emily Maddison, and the dashing Mrs.
Davenport, were two very distinct characters; she had married a man of immense riches,
and a very slave to fashion. The gay scenes of London, to which he hastily introduced his
beautiful bride in the winter he had wedded her, took a speedy and rooted effect, in a
mind naturally weak; her unassuming character easily degenerated into a total want of
proper self-opinion; and she was hurried onwards, only as the stream of fashionable
customs and manners might carry her. The few virtues of her mind were quickly
swallowed up in the vortex of dissipation; and though at first she loved her husband, who
was certainly very handsome, and two years younger than herself, yet, in less than one
twelvemonth, she cared so little about him, that he became perfectly indifferent to her:
while the flutterers of the day breathed soft nonsense and new compliments in her ear, her
husband's ardour cooled towards her, and the fops of fashion were preferred for their
continued assiduity. Mr. Davenport soon began to feel that the highest satisfaction he
derived from his married state, was the repeated remarks of his wife being the
handsomest and best-dressed woman in the whole circle of fashion. Mrs. Davenport was once, not only beautiful, she was also in an high degree
fascinating: yet the various scenes of dissipation in which she was engaged, with the
lateness of the hours she kept, soon destroyed her charms, and in eight years she scarce
shewed the reliques of what she had been; every inventive art was essayed towards the
restoration of a beauty once solely indebted to nature, and with some success on a face yet
lovely, and more hurt by the vigils of fashion than by years. It is true she might have been the very young mother of Margaret, but she looked
as young as she did; and observing no prospect of rivalship in such a girl, her natural
good-nature, which seldom or ever deserted her, suggested the kind idea of taking her
home, as a cherished proteg�e: the word daughter, for a girl of seventeen, though only by
adoption, would have terrified her from performing the beneficent action. *It was now some years since her husband and she had made the accommodating
agreement between themselves, to let each other act, in every respect, as should best
please them individually: they were both lively and good-humoured, they were both
gentlefolks, and there was no acrimony or vulgar quarrels between them. Mr. Davenport
had his ch�re amie in private lodgings, without any concealment from his wife, or
experiencing the smallest degree of disagreeable jealousy or uncomfortable expostulation
on her part: while Mrs. Davenport, who was naturally much more the dupe of her vanity
than of a roving disposition, was as eager to make conquests, and afford hope to the
unprincipled train of libertines who followed her, as any single coquette, whose chief
delight may be in the number of her admirers. But Mrs. Davenport, though her heart was warm by its natural generosity, had
much more of the English frigidity than the Italian amoroso in her composition. At the latter end of the ensuing week, after Mrs. Davenport had paid her visit to
the farm-house, Margaret was conveyed by her and her husband, in an elegant carriage
and four, to their magnificent house in Grosvenor-square: she had seen, it is true, an high
degree of taste and splendour at the parsonage, but here, all that the most refined luxury
could invent, or opulence bestow, presented itself to charm her eyes and delude her warm
imagination. She was immediately put in possession of a beautifully decorated dressing-room
and bed-chamber, which, with all her native sweetness and polish of manners, Mrs.
Davenport desired her, while she gave her at the same time a kind embrace, to consider
her own. Margaret had been put into very handsome mourning for her uncle, at Mrs.
Davenport's expence: she was now in a fine black cloth riding-habit, and being in sables,
her dress she knew would be soon adjusted for their seven o'clock dinner, and throwing
off her hat, she sat down on a superb sofa-bed, to admire all around her, and feast her
eyes with the beauty of that apartment, which she had been told to consider as her own. The beautifully devised little fire-screens, the emigrant bellows, and the portable
book-cases, all shewed the opulence of their possessors, and the elaborate skill of the
artist; they were not only tasteful trifles, they were costly; of the most expensive
materials, and of the choicest and most difficult to be obtained foreign wood that could be
purchased. It was autumn, the weather was warm, and the half-open windows wafted with
every breath of air the ravishing fragrance of the exotic plants, which were placed on
small stands on each side a long pier-glass, in which Margaret did not fail to take a
frequent survey of her form and dress from head to foot. All the distilled perfumes of
English flowers, with that of the Eastern rose, she found in beautiful little bottles, in the
recesses of her handsome and modern constructed dressing-table. *Historique. She took down a book or two, in order to see of what her little library consisted. The trifling productions of the day formed the chief part; among which, she found some
works of Mrs. Kennedy's, and having often perused them before, she took down various
others, to see if she could find any similar to those works formerly lent her by Lady
Isabella Raymond; but this library consisted a good deal of trials for modern
indiscretions, and some loose novels in the French language, such as Le Sofa, Les
Avantures d'un jeun Turc, and a few more by the unrestrained writers which have
flourished since the revolution: there were also a few English poems, where morality was
quite unheeded, their subjects addressed only to the senses, while their language breathed
a mixture of tenderness, delicacy, and sentiment, all calculated to warm the imagination,
and turn the principles of virtue from their pure and genuine source. Some of these
beautiful hanging shelves teemed with scandalous publications, not very new; such as the
Rising Sun, The Noble Cornutos, The Piccadilly Ambulator, and The Epics of the Ton. The clock striking six, made her start up and think of beginning her toilette for
dinner, especially, too, as Mademoiselle Minette, the French attendant of Mrs. Davenport,
came to request her to accept her assistance. Margaret rose and curtesied to one whom she really thought was a modern fine
lady, and evidently much her superior in outward appearance, address and undress-for
her shoulders and bosom were literally bare, as were her arms, from the wrist to a small
strap, called a sleeve, and all the other covering of her arms were a very handsome pair of
bracelets: her dark hair was elegantly dressed, and fastened up with a gilt coronet comb;
what little there was of her gown, was of a fine pink muslin; her cheeks were highly
rouged, while her whole air had all that effrontery of a woman of high fashion, who sets
the opinion of others at an independent defiance. She advanced, however, with that mingled ease and politeness of manner which
French women alone possess, to offer her assistance: Margaret, with much na�vet�, said,
"Oh! madam, I cannot think of troubling you, and besides, I am generally accustomed
entirely to dress myself. "-
"But, ma ch�re demoiselle, c'est mon occupation," said the lively Minette, "I am
but the soubrette of Madame Davenport, and I should have done me the honour of
waiting on you sooner, but that madame could not be pleased with the way I had arranged
her hair; and she has had it altered five time; and, � la fin, I have had to comb it all out,
and put on a chevelure! "- "What is that?" said Margaret, who, though ashamed of her
former mistake, in conceiving the chambermaid to be a lady of fashion, yet her curiosity
could not rest till she knew what Mrs. Davenport had put on her head; and not being very
conversant in modern French, she had not heard the term. "Ah! Mon Dieu!" replied Mademoiselle, "you know not-I believe, indeed, you
call it vig, but madame would faint at the word." Margaret now thought she saw that the
sly Minette appeared to laugh at her rustic ignorance; and she resolved in future to
observe in silence, and be less inquisitive; she therefore coolly said, "I shall not want any
assistance from you to-day, so leave me; for perhaps Mrs. Davenport may want you. "-
"Eh! non, je vous assure," said Minette, "mais attendez! Madame expect to-night one
gentleman she love ver much, so she tell me to bring number of apologies to you, because
she wish me to make her very much amiable; and she say, to-morrow, if she has time, she
will see for one fille to wait expr�s upon you." Margaret's yet uncontaminated heart, could not help overflowing at the repeated
instances of Mrs. Davenport's kindness; but Minette appeared astonished at this English
refinement of sensibility, and said, "Eh! mon Dieu, vous pleurez, donc? tenez-I have
some rouge in my bosom, la voil�! put it on your cheeks, you are so pale. "-"No, I am
very well," said Margaret, "therefore, leave me now; I had rather be alone. "-"Mais donc,
mademoiselle, mettez en," said the soubrette: "Non, non," said Margaret, "Je vous
dis. "- "Eh! donc, mettez un petit peu de �a," said the persevering Minette. "No, I tell
you," said Margaret, half angry, "I desire you will go, I want no assistance, and you only
hinder me from dressing." Minette shrugged her shoulders and retired. Margaret had now heard there was to be company in the evening, and she felt
much surprised that there should be any gentleman that Mrs. Davenport, a married
woman, "loved very much;" but, she thought, of course, it must be some near relation,
some cousin, it might be; or perhaps, as she had been so particular about her dress, some
odd kind of uncle, whom she was desirous of pleasing: but then again, she recollected
that many of the French novels she had perused did not exclude lovers because a woman
was married; quite the contrary; but then, O dear, Mrs. Davenport was so different, she
was too good, she was sure; and Mr. Davenport was too handsome for his wife to love
any other man. However, there was to be company, and gentlemen were expected; and Margaret
was not yet judicious enough to know how to dress herself; and the elegant crape frock,
trimmed with bugles, which Mrs. Davenport had purchased for her to appear in at the
Argyle Rooms or the Pantheon, she took out to wear on this evening; after having
adorned her hair, which never curled well, and which was now rather deranged by her
journey, with a jet diadem. She had never, since her days of infancy, worn a frock; and now she found all her
efforts in vain, to dress herself without assistance; particularly from the breadth of her
back, and a want of pliancy in her arms, which made her unable to button it. The clock
struck seven, it chimed a quarter after, but she was yet no forwarder; and applying herself
to the bell, she rang with all her might, but no one answered; again, and again she rang,
after waiting several minutes between each pull which she gave the bell-rope. It was half-past seven, and dinner had not yet been announced: five gentlemen and
two ladies had arrived to a friendly dinner; and, in the many pretty things these gentlemen
were uttering to her, Mrs. Davenport forgot that such a person as her dear proteg�e was in
the house; while she was not handsome enough for Mr. Davenport to think at all about
her; who, never much at his ease in the company of modest women, drawled out a few
civil speeches to the lady and her daughter, who composed the female part of his guests. At length a servant came to say the dinner was served up; and an eager contention took
place for the hand of the brilliant hostess, in which, however, the nearest to her succeeded
in obtaining; and they all descended to the dining-parlour, without once giving a thought
to poor Margaret, who, in her first effort to ring the bell, had broken the cordon, and
therefore not one servant had heard it ring. At length one of the footmen in waiting, said,
in a low voice, to his mistress, "I fancy, madam, no one has informed Miss Marsham that
the dinner is ready." Mrs. Davenport now seemed ready to expire with laughter, and
turning to the gentleman who was seated next to her, she said, "Well, was there ever such
a creature as I am? Do you know, I brought a little girl out of the country with me for a


companion, yesterday, and we arrived only here this morning, from Ingatestone, at which
place we slept last night, and I do assure you I had quite forgot she was in the house! Mr.
Davenport, why did not you think of Miss Marsham? Order," continued she, turning to
the footman, "Mademoiselle Minette to go up to her immediately; and if she is already
engaged with her, send up one of the maids to Miss Marsham's dressing-room, and beg
her to come down,-tell her we have half dined." Mr. Davenport replied, turning his looks chiefly towards the company, - "Why,
really, Emily, had you brought home a young lady of seventeen, any thing tolerable in her
person, I perhaps might have thought about her; but I assure you, my dear friends, she has
picked out such an ugly little devil, that strangers might imagine my wife was vulgar
enough to be jealous of me." Mademoiselle Minette, however, hastily buttoned Margaret's frock, and down she
went: but though Margaret looked far from well, and though mourning was by no means
becoming to one, whose naturally good skin had been discoloured into duskiness by the
small-pox, yet the flurry she had experienced, had imparted a very pretty glow to her
cheeks; and the depreciation of her person by Mr. Davenport was infinitely to her
advantage, for the company was prepared to see a fright. She was not, however, embarrassed by the bold looks of a set of fashionable men;
for they regarded her with a cold indifference, and their eyes instantly reverted to the
good things which were set before them. This was a friendly party: Mrs. Davenport was dressed more in a style of
voluptuous coquetry, than in any degree of splendour; but Margaret, whose sight was
rather short, thought some other lady had taken the head of the table, and she looked for
her benefactress in vain; for Mrs. Davenport had tucked up her beautiful light-brown hair
under a wig almost black; till presently, her well-known voice made Margaret turn
towards her, and she easily discovered her, by her peculiar and bewitching smile.
