Mary, who knew that Margaret's
chief delight was to sit alone for hours, poring over a romance, feared this was now the
cause of her refusing to accompany her; she entreated her to go with her, with all the
persuasion she was mistress of, adding, that she could not possibly think of going without
her. Margaret, however, told her, if possible, she would follow time enough for dinner;
but desired her sister to tell their friends not to wait a moment, for she would be sure to
be there very early in the afternoon; and Mary finding all she could say useless to her
obstinate sister, hastened to the dwelling of her friend, Miss Ringwood. Lucy Ringwood and Mary Marsham might justly be styled congenial souls: in
person, Lucy was more pleasing than pretty, yet there was something about her so
irresistible, that she was perpetually making conquests; though, with all her mind's
perfections, there was such an etourderie about her, that she never long retained the
hearts of her numerous captives. She had been left an orphan early, and was now the darling proteg�e of a rich maiden
aunt, her mother's only sister; who, though a spinster of sixty, was free from every


caprice and narrowness of idea so often, not to say, sometimes unjustly, imputed to that
proscribed class of ladies. Mrs. Susanna Bradbury laughed with all the hearty glee of seventeen, and enjoyed a
free jest, and a neat pointed philippie, against prudery, with a pleased vivacity, devoid of
all envy, and replete with admiration of the witty person's talents who might have
composed it. Her conversation was free and unrestrained, full of good sense and
cheerfulness, and she loved and admired the young and handsome. Yet in her figure, the
quizzing buck has set her down, the moment he beheld her, as a fair object for sport; but
Mrs. Susan has soon made him repent the onset, by the keenness and brilliancy of her
repartees, which, though free from all illnatured severity, have been so full of point, that
he has wished he had let her alone. Her company and conversation were ever considered a treat by the young, the lively,
and sensible: she had a fine and retentive memory, a well cultivated understanding, a fund
of anecdote and ready wit, and with those select friends, where she knew she was safe,
she shewed herself a most excellent mimic. Her form was tall and spare; her face had been very pretty, and still bore the visible
remains of its powers of pleasing; her grey locks, which she took no pains to conceal or
disguise, peeped from beneath her fine black laced hood; her long taper waist, pointed
before with a diamond stay-hook, her stiff rich silk gown and quilted satin petticoat,
under a clear starched apron, and her paste shoe-buckles, in her satin shoes, truly
characterised an old maid in the very beginning of the last century. She loved Mary with the same affection she did her Lucy, and a more happy or more
merry trio never sat down to dinner than they, on this eventful day. Yes, the day was eventful to the heroine, Margaret: in order that nothing should
hinder her in the execution of the important task she had set herself, she dressed herself in
readiness to go out in the evening, before she began her investigations. She knew Mrs. Susanna Bradbury loved neatness; she therefore arrayed herself in
clean and fine white muslin: she had very indifferent hair, of a dull and dirtyish light
brown colour. Having been too sleepy to curl it the night before, it hung about in a stringy
kind of disorder over her face, and she injudiciously put over it, in that state, a wreath of
white roses. Thus equipped, with a deep sigh, she began to ascend the old worm-eaten
staircase, which led to the upper store-rooms. Whoever has seen the stairs at the Castle
Inn, at Kingston, may form an idea of the numerous, short-ascending and broken steps
which Margaret now went up; and large balls of wood, similar to what we see at the
above-mentioned inn, were likewise placed as ornaments on the balustrades of Mr.
Marsham's staircase; these she regarded a few moments, convinced they must have been
the helmets worn by some of her warlike ancestors; and she then, with a reflection on the
years and ages that had passed since those brave heroes had mingled with their native
dust, proceeded onwards. She entered the apple-chamber, where a few half-rotten solitary apples were yet lying
on the straw. "Such," said she aloud, "such are the uses now, oh! palace of my ancestors,
to which thy lofty apartments are assigned!"-"Anan!" said a voice which seemed to
come from beneath; Margaret started:-"Oh!" cried she, "as my beloved Shakespear says,
"Oh! speak, perturbed spirit!" "Anan!" again returned the voice: "Ah! say, speak," said the agitated Margaret, "was then
the name, revered dame, which you bore while on earth, Anannia?" "Why what is't thee be doing there?" said the rude voice of one of the labourers, as
he ascended a few steps of a staircase which led to the back-kitchen; "why, as true as I'm
a living soul, if here be'n't our Miss Peggy, as clean as a broide, up i'th' apple-loft! Why
laws, miss, there ben't one there as is fit for a christian to eat." Margaret retreated-"Oh! one of these vile plebeians belonging to my uncle,"
thought she, "has prevented me from learning the hard and perhaps horrible fate of the
beauteous Lady Anannia! but I must use stratagem to develop the mysteries which
surround me." "Thomas," said she, in a soft voice, "I do not want any apples, I am only come here
to kill a little time! "-"Why, miss," replied Thomas, "if you wants, as how, to be culling
thyme, there be none up there, but there be a power of it in the garden, tho'f to be sure,
'tis now in flower; so if you will be pleased to come down here a few steps, I'll shew you
the room where un puts the dried yerbes." Though Margaret saw how much he had misinterpreted her words, yet she thought,
as the apple-chamber was so full of adventure, that the herb-closet might have also its
share of the marvellous, and she followed the man with trembling feet and a pallid cheek. "Laws! miss, why you be'n't frightened, be you?" said he, looking at her. "Oh! no,"
said she, squatting down on a bundle of dried sage, "but I wish to be left alone: go. "-
"Oh! yes, miss, I must go, for I'se got a main deal to do; but mind me miss, when you's
done, you'd better go back the way you com'd: you'd better not attempt to set foot on that
there little bit of a staircase; for d'ye see, its so mortal auld, that a body might break un's
neck if un were to attempt to go down it." Margaret waved her hand, impatient for his
departure, being fully resolved, after such a prohibition, at all events to descend the
ruined flight of stairs. She stepped down several without danger, for her frame and footsteps were light, but
to the left she beheld a broken door with a rusty iron bolt, half dropping from the staple:
breathless with the ideas of adventure and romantic peril, heated with the phantoms of her
imagination, she sprang forward and tore her hand with the shattered remains of the bolt. The door, which hung but by one hinge, she could only open by so small a degree,
that she found she could not obtain an entrance; but a cursory peep at the green damp of
the walls, made her resolve, even if it should be with the hazard of her life, to gain
admittance: in her efforts to squeeze herself through, she rent her new and best plain
muslin gown from the top to the bottom, and dreadfully scratched her arms and face
against the broken and rusty iron work of the decayed door: but having, at length,
accomplished her purpose, she found herself in a small dark-looking room, which could
not, from its appearance, have been inhabited or made use of for a considerable length of
time: every rotten board shook under her feet, and imparted the fearful idea, that it would
soon precipitate her into some hideous cavern: she heard the most piercing shrieks, and
sometimes a sound of mingled voices; presently the shrieks were hushed, and she was
certain that she distinguished the voice of her Phelim. "Alas! alas," thought she, "dear and constant youth, I am unworthy of thy affections;
but oh! what can have brought thee to this remote spot but the intuitive power of almighty


love? Oh! if thou art in danger from the spells of magic, or the influence of evil spirits,
thy Margaritta will, by one great and heroic effort of sublime virtue, cast her present
noble lover from her too susceptible heart, and fly to succour thee, or share all thy perils,
as I am assured thou wouldst mine. But where can I fly?" thought she, as she again
essayed to open the door somewhat wider, in order to effect her exit from this ruinous
apartment. She now exerted the utmost powers of her strength, and by one great effort, the other
broken and rust-worn hinge came off the door, and down fell its remains on the poor
terrified Margaret, whose weight, with that of the door together, was too much for the
fragile boards, and the heroine of romance was precipitated into a noisome and offensive
dungeon. A squeaking noise assailed her ears, and she felt herself seized by the remnants
of her gown by some terrific kind of being, who appeared, to her bewildered senses, to
utter something like a stifled groan: in her endeavours to disengage herself, she trod on
something soft, and apparently alive, when a feeble shriek met her ear, and a violent
hubbub of shrieking and groaning, or rather squeaking and grunting; for Margaret had
fallen into a dark stye, where lay a sow and her litter of pigs: but that she did not yet
discover, and dreading to remain an instant where she was, her fears made her desperate,
and perceiving a ray of light from a chink in the boards, which surrounded the enraged
grunter's dwelling, she forcibly applied her hand to it; when Phelim, in a neighbouring
barn, hearing the knocking, undid the wooden fastening on the outside, and discovered
his young mistress in a condition which rendered her hardly cognisable. "Oh! my brave, my generous deliverer!" said she, as she sprang towards him.-"Why
how in the name of St. Patrick, came you here, miss?" said he, "and och, as sure as I'm
my own mother's son, if you have not killed the titman peg! poor little bit of a beast, how
it lies there, with not a bit of breath in its body!" "Oh! God forbid!" cried Margaret, who did not want tenderness or good-nature, "I
hope not; do, Phelim, try to recover it. "-"Och come, the little beast is not quite cold; I'll
put it to its own mother-make yourself aisy, miss, these things cannot be helped." "Oh! Phelim," said Margaret, "what have I not gone through this afternoon!" "By J-s, miss, I think you came through the old loft overhead; and how the d--
did you find your way there?" "By descending the mysterious and prohibited staircase," replied Margaret. "Oh! by my soul, and I don't know where that is; it has a rum kind of name,
however!" "I will tell you all another time," said Margaret: "but how can I ever reward you for
your bravery in unbarring the door of my dungeon!" "As for that, miss, I see no great bravery in opening the door of a pig-stye; I thought
the sow had been in her tantrums, and I looked to see what was the matter." "Your delicacy, generous youth," said she, "makes light of this matter: oh! that I had
but some valuable ring or scarf to bestow!" Phelim, who now found her, as she often was to his limited capacity, wholly
unintelligible, said to her, "But sure, miss, you're in a broth of a pickle, and if you'd take
my advice, you'll just step into the barn, and be after wiping off the mud with a clean
wisp of straw." Margaret took the advice of O'Gurphy, but turning to go into the barn, she perceived,
at a little distance, a pool of a very sanguinary appearance, she started and screamed
aloud, "Ah! I knew foul murder had been committed!" "Why yes, miss," said Phelim, grinning, "they have indeed been committing what
you call murder!" "And you laugh, Phelim, and speak of it as if it was no crime to perpetrate so
dreadful an act!" "Holy St. Patrick! why you don't think such kind of murder can be any sin, do you?" "What," said Margaret, "did they kill the holy St. Patrick?" "Och! and I would be glad to know the Irish boys that would have dared to have done
that! but, miss, it was as fine a young peg as ever sucked, that was kilt a little while ago;
and the master means to have it roasted on Sunday: it squeaked like any young devil, but I
dispatched it as soon as I could, for I hate to see the poor little lumps of animals tortured." Margaret now finding herself in her uncle's barn-yard, and somewhat ashamed of her
misconceptions, entered the barn, and said to Phelim, "Now, while I wipe off some of this
mud, do go and see if the poor little pig I hurt, is alive! If it is, I shall go to rest happy." "Och! and I believe it's as dead as Julus Caesar, or Judas Caret," said the Hibernian;
"but I'll go and see, to plase you, miss." "Oh!" thought she, when she was alone, "how, in spite of his ignoble disguise, does
his learning and native dignity discover itself! In common discourse he gives as a
comparison the great Julius Caesar, even when speaking of the death of a little pig; and I
wonder who he meant by Judas Caret? no doubt one of his own high and noble
ancestors." To the great joy, however, of Margaret, Phelim returned with the glad tidings that the
poor little crater was likely to live; and she now hastened to her chamber, to see if she
could arrange her figure in any kind of way, time enough to keep her promised
engagement at Mrs. Susanna Bradbury's cottage. How shocked was the poor girl when she contemplated her figure in the glass! The
bruises under her eyes portended a rueful blackness, her wreath of roses were full of
cobwebs, her gown torn to tatters, and covered with the dirt of the pig-stye; her arms,
neck, and hands, made hideous by innumerable scratches, while the pains in her bruised
limbs made her feel, that instead of going out she must absolutely go to bed. Thus ended this day's adventures of Margaret; pleasing to her, in vision; cruelly
mortifying in reality: she dispatched a message to Mrs. Susan, that not being very well,
she hoped that lady would excuse her for breaking her promise. They all thought her
indisposition was only one of her nervous head-achs, from intense application to her
favourite studies; and while they spoke of the ill-effects of such constant reading, on the
mind and health of a young creature, and thinking it was no other cause which kept her
away, Mary continued to enjoy, with these, her true friends, the cheerful and unrestrained
hours till ten o'clock, when Mrs. Susan's servant saw her safe home. Mrs. Susanna Bradbury loved both the sisters; she loved them for the sake of their
worthy father and uncles, and she often conversed with Edward on the romantic
propensity of his youngest daughter; but perfectly agreed with that sensible man, that, to
entirely prohibit those kind of books (the morals of which, however absurd their incidents
and events, were unexceptionable) would be only to teach the gaining them by stealth;


and then, works of a more dangerous tendency might corrupt the heart and undermine the
principles of his girl: while the works she now perused, only ensnared the imagination for
a time; and as her years increased, he hoped she would be able to see the folly of giving
credit to them, and only draw from them those sentiments and feelings which they were
intended by their authors to inspire;-an admiration of their ingenuity, and the grandeur
and sublimity of their language; with an abhorrence of vice, and a sincere love and
veneration for virtue. Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow,
Thou wilt not escape calumny. SHAKESPEARE. ------Shall one doubtful act,
Arraign a life of innocence unblam'd? DODSLEY'S CLEONE. IT may be a matter of surprise, that a lady of respectable connexions and good
fortune, as was Mrs. Susanna Bradbury, was not invited with her niece to the ball given
by the Leslies; especially as there was formerly a friendship of the visiting kind between
them; and the noble Rector had also once highly admired Miss Lucy Ringwood: the
independent Mrs. Susanna was herself the only cause of this neglect. An elegant little villa had been purchased by a gentleman, a foreigner from
Switzerland: himself, an English lady, whom he introduced as his adopted daughter, and
three servants, composed his family, besides the lady's pet birds, dog and cats. The
gentleman was between seventy and eighty years of age; his snowy locks waved over his
fine high forehead, and candour and benevolence were seated on his brow: the lady, who
took the charge of his household affairs, was past the bloom of life, but yet many, very
many years younger than himself. Purity, virtue, and philanthropy, form the basis of the Swiss character; and if ever one
country can lay a peculiar claim to those noble principles,-it is Switzerland! Her sons,
all mind, and not the slaves of sense, can enjoy the chaste platonic intercourse with a
different sex which the voluptuous Englishman sneers at, and knows not how to estimate. The respectable Mr. Rouveau was eminent for possessing the virtues we have cited;
how oft has he denied himself the luxuries of life, to impart its comforts to others! How
conscious in the rectitude of his own heart and mind, has he gloried in seeing the friend
he protected, excite admiration by the superiority of her talents and the charms of her
person: nor had he an idea that one impure thought could enter any bosom on his and her
account: he knew too well how to render his age respectable; neither did he care for a
world narrow in its ideas, however enlightened, and of which he was totally independent:
the poor, the indigent, never assailed his hospitable gate in vain, nor left it unrelieved. Such were the uses this excellent man made of his large fortune: he owed no man any
thing; while many owed to him all the comforts of life they enjoyed, and which, before
they knew him, seemed fled from them for ever! The titled, the rich, were seldom invited
to partake of his plentiful dinners; no, his parlour-table was continually open to the
worthy gentleman of small fortune, the widow with a very limited jointure, the
industrious genteel-bred wife, whose husband, perhaps, languished in a prison for debt;
while his kitchen was filled every Sunday by large families of fatherless children and their
widowed mothers, whom he knew were real objects of charity. But the noble and warm


heart of this beneficent man had keenly felt the arrows of ingratitude; yet they could never
pierce deep enough to stop the continual flow of his benevolence: Oh! active christianity,
it is thou, and thou alone that can hope for the favour of approving heaven! Mrs. Edmonds, the female friend of this worthy man, grateful, contented, and happy,
was proud of the friendship and favour of a mind like his, and which friendship had
increased in numberless acts of kindness, during a period of three and twenty years, since
the commencement of which term she had been the widow of an officer, and was left with
only her pension for her support. Mr. Rouveau had long known her family; had known her from the earliest period of
infancy; and his doors and heart were open to receive the distressed and pretty young
widow: the idea never entered his pure mind, that there could be any thing amiss in
granting an honourable and safe asylum to the daughter of an old friend, because she
happened to be a female; and because she was in the flower of youth, and her
countenance lively and charming, he did not see why that should be a reason that she was
to be debarred the fatherly care and protection which he could afford her! She had always revered his character, and almost loved him as a parent; and in the
heyday of youth and giddy innocence, she exultingly told her friends how happily situated
she was going to be! The young fellows laughed, and said, "Aye, aye, let alone these old
gentlemen; they are connoisseurs in the sex." While her female acquaintance screwed up
their mouths, and looked meaningly on each other: next time she called on them they
were not at home; and, for a few years she had not many visitors, except of the opposite
sex: the correctness, however, of her conduct, her talents, her skill in music, her fine
voice, and a more powerful motive still, Mr. Rouveau's fine fortune, gained them many
and highly respectable friends of both sexes. Mrs. Edmonds had only been comparatively
happy before,-she was now completely so; for her heart was formed for friendship, and
she loved society, because she found she always pleased in it: the more her newly
acquired friends conversed with her, the more they saw in her to admire, and checked
themselves for ever associating the idea of mistress with that of Mr. Rouveau's adopted
daughter. Change of air being requisite to preserve
"The green old age unconscious of decays,"
of Mr. Rouveau, and the lease of his house in town being expired, he purchased a villa at
Eglantine, intending to make a long summer there, and devote only two or three of the
winter months to London, in ready-furnished lodgings. Mrs. Susanna Bradbury, who had in her early years been acquainted with the mother
of Mrs. Edmonds, immediately paid her respects to her after her appearance at church:
these two liberal-minded women were charmed with each other: Mrs. Susan, who could
listen for hours to vocal music, and weep at those fine airs, which the sweet voice of Mrs.
Edmonds knew how to sing to the heart, was most happy in those delighted hours she
could pass with so captivating a companion, who, instead of setting an improper example,
was the gentle and prudent monitor, to correct and kindly admonish the giddiness of her
Lucy's youth. The Rector, from his pulpit, admired the fine black eyes of Mrs. Edmonds, who
looked at him from attentive devotion only: but it was impossible, he said, for his family
to visit her! Lady Caroline, who but a few weeks before had aided her sister in an
elopement, declared, if ever she happened to fall into company with her, she should
certainly quit it instantly! and fearful such an event might take place, she must beg Mr.
Leslie entirely to give up the acquaintance of the Bradburies; which imparted not the least
pain to the mind of Mrs. Susan; who never went to church (so much did she abhor to see
a man's example eternally at war with his precepts) except when the worthy Edward
Marsham performed the religious duty; for though she had formerly been of the Rector's
parties, she detested the free principles of his family; and lamented, that with such fine
sense, such a lovely person and enlarged ideas, Lady Isabella should glory in infidelity,
and be the victim to her false and dangerous opinions. While she knew, also, that Lady
Caroline, with all her pretended correctness, clasped to her bosom the divorced wife, and
the well-known adulteress, if they chanced to be gifted with title and fortune. Lady Isabella, who sat the world at defiance, when she has been riding or walking
with all her sister's high and fashionable party, has stopped at the window, as she passed
by the villa, to chat with Mrs. Edmonds, or stop her horse, and condescendingly talk to
her over the garden-wall; but this she did, not from any admiration or certainty of the
lady's virtue, on the contrary, she told every one, she really believed her to be the mistress
of Mr. Rouveau; but what of that? if she chose to notice her, she would: every one had a
right to do as they pleased; for her part, she found her an agreeable, sensible woman: she
certainly, as her brother did not approve of it, would not bring her to his house;
consequently she could not call herself at the villa; but as far as private notice went, she
would not, like Caroline, turn up her nose, and toss away her head, whenever she met her
by chance." A suspicion shot across the mind of Sir Edward Harrington, that she really was the
daughter of Mr. Rouveau, and he fancied he could discover a likeness between them. Where not even the severest censor could find any thing bordering on incorrectness,
he thought it a cruel deprivation to society, that it should be debarred from those whose
talents and merits give to it its brightest ornaments: and while he was charmed with the
conversation of this polished and virtuous pair, he longed to introduce Mrs. Edmonds
among the circle of his friends; not that he could call the Leslies by that sacred name; but
he knew the influence they held in the country; and that, where they declared off, few
other families of wealth and respectability would choose publicly to visit. Willingly would these courtly friends have delighted in the opulent Mr. Rouveau's
company; but he never associated with those who excluded his proteg�e. Sir Edward hinted one evening, to the Honourable and Reverend Theodore Leslie,
his suspicions of a very near relationship between Mr. Rouveau and Mrs. Edmonds. "My
good fellow," said the Rector, "why then does he not come forward, and own it?
