In short, Mr Mucklewheel, ye see it requires a canny
hand to manage public affairs, and a sound discretion to know who are the
fittest to work in them. If the case were not my own, and if I was
speaking for another that had done for the town what I have done, the
task would be easy. For I would just rise in my place, and say as a
thing of course, and admitted on all hands, 'Gentlemen, it would be a
very wrong thing of us, to let Mr Mucklewheel, (that is, supposing you
were me,) who has so long been a fellow-labourer with us, to quit his
place here without some mark of our own esteem for him as a man, and some
testimony from the council to his merits as a magistrate. Every body
knows that he has been for near to fifty years a distinguished character,
and has thrice filled the very highest post in the burgh; that many great
improvements have been made in his time, wherein his influence and wisdom
was very evident; I would therefore propose, that a committee should be
appointed to consider of the best means of expressing our sense of his
services, in which I shall be very happy to assist, provided the provost
will consent to act as chairman.' "That's the way I would open the business; and were I the seconder, as
you are to be to Mr Birky, I would say,

"'The worthy councillor has but anticipated what every one was desirous
to propose, and although a committee is a very fit way of doing the thing
respectfully, there is yet a far better, and that is, for the council now
sitting to come at once to a resolution on the subject, then a committee
may be appointed to carry that resolution into effect.' "Having said this, you might advert first to the vote of thanks, and then
to the piece of plate, to remain with the gentleman's family as a
monumental testimony of the opinion which was entertained by the
community of his services and character." Having in this judicious manner primed Mr Mucklewheel as to the
procedure, I suddenly recollected that I had a letter to write to catch
the post, and having told him so, "Maybe," quo' I, "ye would step the
length of Mr Birky's and see how he is inclined, and by the time I am
done writing, ye can be back; for after all that we have been saying, and
the warm and friendly interest you have taken in this business, I really
would not wish my friends to stir in it, unless it is to be done in a
satisfactory manner." Mr Mucklewheel accordingly went to Mr Birky, who had of course heard
nothing of the subject, but they came back together, and he was very
vogie with the notion of making a speech before the council, for he was
an upsetting young man. In short, the matter was so set forward, that,
on the Monday following, it was all over the town that I was to get a
piece of plate at my resignation, and the whole affair proceeded so well
to an issue, that the same was brought to a head to a wish. Thus had I
the great satisfaction of going to my repose as a private citizen with a
very handsome silver cup, bearing an inscription in the Latin tongue, of
the time I had been in the council, guildry, and magistracy; and
although, in the outset of my public life, some of my dealings may have
been leavened with the leaven of antiquity, yet, upon the whole, it will
not be found, I think, that, one thing weighed with another, I have been
an unprofitable servant to the community. Magistrates and rulers must
rule according to the maxims and affections of the world; at least,
whenever I tried any other way, strange obstacles started up in the
opinions of men against me, and my purest intents were often more
criticised than some which were less disinterested; so much is it the
natural humour of mankind to jealouse and doubt the integrity of all
those who are in authority and power, especially when they see them
deviating from the practices of their predecessors. Posterity,
therefore, or I am far mistaken, will not be angered at my plain dealing
with regard to the small motives of private advantage of which I have
made mention, since it has been my endeavour to show and to acknowledge,
that there is a reforming spirit abroad among men, and that really the
world is gradually growing better--slowly I allow; but still it is
growing better, and the main profit of the improvement will be reaped by
those who are ordained to come after us.
