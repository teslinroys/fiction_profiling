Blessed be the ALMIGHTY
for the paternal instinct he implants in our bosoms; and that your father, in spite of all the
calumny that assailed me, knew it was his own child which he clasped to his fond heart! The sweetest satisfaction I ever knew, since my days of sorrow, was in once hearing that
your father declared, that "in many instances, he never knew a mind so great as mine; that
I might once err; but that my soul was too naturally virtuous, ever to repeat my error." I
hope he was not deceived in me; but oh! when he thought me thus excellent, why not
joyfully pass his life in honourable marriage with such a woman? "Yet this, his last expression concerning me which ever reached my ears, gives
comfort to the last hours of my life, and I die most happy! Visit then the grave of your
mother, and think of her last request! She releases you from the promise, but think, oh
think! of her dying wishes; oh! my son, they centre all in thy happiness and honour. May
thy fair tree of manhood be rich in those fruits of integrity, humanity and goodness, for
which the blossoms of thy youth bid so fair! Beware of deception, beware the influence of
the passions: marry the object of your fond choice, and lead a life of respected honour;
but be ever cautious of carrying misery and regret into a family, by the indulgence of
inclination, or the too easy yieldings of female youth and inexperience: be assured, in the
circles of life in which I have moved, and in those which you will most probably fill, man
is the first aggressor, and on that superior sex much depends the morality of every class of
life. "The hand that writes this will have perished in the silent grave long before you
attain the period of discretion, marked out by my father, to put you in possession of your
inheritance: lay the last words of your earthly parent to your heart, and be assured that by


practising virtue, and doing to every one as you would wish them to act towards you, you
will ensure the favour of your HEAVENLY FATHER. "Farewell,
"JANE MATTHEWS." (At the bottom was recently written, in Matthew Marsham's own hand-writing; "My dear
Mother departed this life March 23d, in the third year of my apprenticeship.") Eh! le voeu le plus libre et le plus volontaire,
Devant Dieu qui prevoit tout, peut sembler t�meraire. LA HARPE. ------------Hence venal love! Love, that is slave to gold, is such a monster,
So senseless quite, and so abominable,
As the earth breeds not, or the ocean holds
In his dark caverns.--------
AMINTA OF TASSO. SCARCELY had Edward finished perusing the affecting tale of sorrow which had
been penned during a last, lingering illness, by the once beautiful Miss Matthews, when a
note was brought him from his nephew, informing him he was just arrived from Suffolk,
and requesting to see him at the farm. He had again resumed his deep mourning habit, which before had become more
slight, since the months that had elapsed after his father's decease; and on his face sat a
settled grief, which did not agree with that of the possessor of a handsome independent
fortune: but how little happiness that capricious goddess can bestow, even when she
pours her wealth in abundance into the lap of mortals, the lacerated mind and anguished
heart, sighing under the garb of gorgeous pomp, can too well evince. Edward was grieved to see this change in so young a man; and in one whose
hilarity and correctly tempered, equal cheerfulness, and flow of spirits, added to all that
amiability he, in every degree, so eminently possessed. Unable to restrain the big tear from starting into his manly eyes, he grasped the
hand of Mr. Marsham, and giving him a sealed parchment, he said, "This I found sealed,
and inclosed in my mother's will, addressed to Mrs. Susanna Bradbury; be pleased
yourself to deliver it into her hands, and also this letter to Miss Ringwood, whom I am
resolved, let the sacrifice cost me whatever it may, never to behold again." Edward, revolving over many circumstances in his mind, and seeing in an instant
that, by some means hitherto unknown, an attachment between these young people had
existed prior to the mandate of the dying Miss Matthews; with a pallid countenance and a
tremulous voice, he said, "My dear Matthew, I hope you have bound yourself by no rash
vow as you knelt on the grave of your mother?" "No," replied he, "that was one of her
last requests; but ought not the other wish of such a mother to be as sacredly fulfilled as if
I had taken the most solemn and binding oath? to me, her wish is as obligatory." He then without farther comment informed his Uncle of his attachment to Miss
Ringwood, and which we, for brevity's sake, will give the reader in simple narration. When Matthew Marsham returned from the West Indies, he became a temporary
resident in London, and at the house of a gentleman and lady, with whom he had been


very intimate, before he visited the Occidental Islands, he met with Lucy Ringwood, who
was there on a visit for several weeks. He was desired to consider this house as his home
during his stay in the metropolis; and thus two amiable young people became inmates
under the same roof. That wonder of literature, which Litchfield had the honour of producing, has
asserted, and with much truth, that it is next to an impossibility for two people of a
different sex, particularly if in the season of youth, to reside for any time together without
experiencing for each other a tender sentiment. Can it then be wondered at, if two young
people, so eminently gifted with the fascinating powers of pleasing as were Matthew
Marsham and Lucy Ringwood, should form that fond attachment which was to mark the
colour of their future lives? This, in many a solitary moment, in many a pleasurable
excursion, became known to each other: mutual faith was plighted!-from Lucy, totally
dependent on a rich aunt, to marry no one else than Matthew Marsham, or for ever wear
the willow;-from him, a solemn promise and fixed resolution to ask her in marriage of
that aunt, whenever a comfortable and easy independence should put it in his power to
offer her, with his hand and heart, a fortune in some degree worthy of her. A private
correspondence was agreed upon, and the virtuous and honourable principles of Matthew
Marsham elevated him each hour in the esteem of his admired fair-one. Lucy, the very
counterpart of her amiable mother, had a soul superior even to her personal attractions,
which were captivating in the extreme; each day brought increased affection for her to the
breast of Matthew, who loved with all that tender and unbounded, though refined, ardour
natural to such a mind as his. By her appointment he attended as a minstrel at Mr. Leslie's masquerade, and
there it may well be imagined the variety of emotions he underwent; he beheld before him
his father, and all his paternal kindred, who knew not at that time they had such a relative
as himself in existence; he longed to throw himself at his father's feet, and receive his
paternal blessings and embrace-and various feelings so agitated his heart, that, though
fondly returned love was the most predominant, yet he was obliged to hasten sooner than
he desired from the festive scene. Lucy Ringwood, at this time, was assailed by an host of suitors; of some her aunt
approved, who much wished to see her well and respectably married, before she herself
was gathered to her ancestors: Matthew Marsham, among the rest, might not, perhaps,
have applied in vain, had he been wealthier, and not dependent on his profession for
support; for Mrs. Susan had been fully convinced by her late sister, though yet ignorant
whose child he was, that he was not the son of the man who was generally suspected; for
Ellen had at length, told her that she knew, but was under a solemn oath not to divulge it;
at the same time, she could take another equally solemn, that he was not the son of
Thomas Smith: as to the name of Marsham, that had never struck Mrs. Susan, as the only
time she ever saw Ralph was at the harvest-supper, and the Miss Bradburys shortly after
took a journey to London, where they stayed till after Mr. Marsham had quitted the house
of Mr. Matthews; and in fact, if she had heard his name, she had entirely forgotten it. Lucy, the cherished, and almost spoiled child of her kind aunt, affected now an
etourderie and caprice, by no means natural to her excellent character; which made her
lovers fall off, one after the other, to the astonishment of every one, and to the branding of
her own conduct, as giddy, trifling, and inconsistent. When Matthew came to take possession of his inheritance, how surprised was his
Lucy, and how overjoyed to find that he stood in something of a relationship to the
dearest friend of her heart, Mrs. Harrington. Mrs. Susanna Bradbury, when Edward, who had no secrets from her, imparted to
her the clause in his late brother's will, took no notice of having known him before. Ellen
had rather offended the jealousy of sisterly affection, in hazarding her resentment, and
giving up every thing to the enthusiastic dictates of the female friendship of early youth:
she, therefore, always desirous of feeling that gay and cheerful disposition so natural to
her, and which she could now evince without censure, sedulously drove from her
remembrance every thing likely to give her pain; and never suffered her tongue to utter
the sorrows of days gone by, nor her mind to dwell on the retrospect of aught that had
given a cloud to the natural bright cheerfulness of her benevolent mind: and as she was
much altered in person, and had not seen Matthew since he was quite a child, they met as
perfect strangers to each other. Edward Marsham acquitted himself now of the unpleasant office his nephew had
assigned him: he found Mrs. Susanna and her lovely niece seated at work, in their little
summer parlour: the first words from Mrs. Susan, after the usual salutations were over,
were, "Pray, is Mr. Matthew Marsham yet returned?" while a deep blush crimsoned the
cheeks of Lucy, and the sparkle of love added new lustre to her intelligent eye; when the
Curate replied in the affirmative. But how soon is the cup of bliss dashed from the lip of mortality, as it hastens to
sip its palatable ingredients! Edward said, "My visit to you, ladies, this morning, is on his
account." And unable, from his own emotions to say more, with an air of solemnity,
delivered the letter to Lucy, and the parchment to her aunt. Mrs. Susan put on her spectacles and prepared to break the seals; she thought
nothing particular-the Curate was not a man of many words; but a smile generally
lighted up his countenance when he was addressing the young and innocent, and the
agitation which the freezing gravity of his present demeanour imparted to the mind of
Lucy, made her move to withdraw. "Read it here, my good girl," said Edward, in a tender
and compassionate accent, which made Lucy tremble as she broke the sombre seal; it
represented Cupid weeping over two hearts, divided by a bar, and encircled by a motto-
"Divided by duty." But when her eye glanced over the few lines wherein her Matthew
took a last, though a tender and affectionate farewell, it was too much for her nature to
support; she gave a faint shriek, and fell senseless on the floor. Mrs. Susan, all terror and dismay, summoned the servants, and with the assistance
of volatiles, they soon brought the unhappy girl to an awakened sense of her wretched
situation. Mrs. Susan, to rally her spirits, affected a gaiety she then by no means felt:
"Here's a pretty business indeed," said she; "why you do not know the good fortune I
have got here for you in this little bit of parchment: many a poor girl would almost lose
her senses with joy; but I hope you will recover your spirits, when I tell you that you are
here bequeathed an independent fortune of ten thousand pounds!"-"Oh! rather," replied
Lucy, not knowing what she said, "rather give me poverty with him, the most generous of
men: he finds me rich, and he thinks himself unworthy of me!" "What does all this mean?" said Mrs. Susan, taking up the letter which her niece
had dropped; and as she read it, a little displeasure appeared seated on her placid brow;


not that she disapproved the worthy object on whom her beloved Lucy had placed her
affections; but the term, "our long attachment," in the letter, proved that a clandestine
correspondence had been carried on, by a niece who was indulged in all her wishes,
always encouraged to place unlimited confidence in her kind aunt, and whom that aunt
had imagined artlessness itself. Taking off her spectacles, she said, with much gravity, "However, Miss
Ringwood, a clause in this codicil will shew you that an union with Mr. Matthew
Marsham is forbidden you; and, of course, whatever affliction it may give you, will be
impracticable." She then read as follows, after resuming her optical glasses. "I wrote my restricting and ardent wishes to my son, Matthew Marsham, that
honour and generosity might never make him aspire to an union with Lucy Ringwood: as
we cannot foresee future events, I think it best thus to prevent a marriage which I wish, on
account of the above-mentioned noble principles, never to take place. To prevent,
therefore, the whole of the sum of twenty thousand pounds sterling ever coming again
into the hands of my son, the said Matthew Marsham, this bequest of ten thousand
pounds, being the half of all the fortune I leave in ready money, devolves only to Lucy
Ringwood on condition that she never marries the said Matthew Marsham, my son. If
such an unlooked-for union ever should take place, the ten thousand pounds devolves to
her aunt, Susanna Bradbury, and at her death to go to John Besborough, banker, in --"
The tears of Lucy Ringwood now streamed afresh: Mr. Marsham had yet the
packet of papers in his pocket, which he had forgotten to deliver to his nephew; but now,
hastily acceding to the painful impulse of his feelings, he presented it to Mrs. Susan, and
said, "Dear madam, read over, as soon as you are at leisure, these papers; you will there
see the generous and delicate reason of this restriction: I am happy to find it thus
expressed in the parchment; Matthew is rich enough, and two amiable young people may
yet be happy, without the addition of ten thousand pounds. Farewell, comfort the poor
little drooping blossom!" and with parental affection he kissed her cheek as he took his
leave, and as he bade her aunt good morning, the good lady's aspect became more serene,
and holding the papers in one hand, as she cordially and gracefully gave the other to
Edward, she said, "My much respected and excellent friend, Lucy well knows that I can
never long be displeased with her; and if she relates, with that sweet candour so natural to
her, and without any prevarication, the commencement and continuance of her first
acquaintance with Mr. Matthew Marsham, whom I already feel myself disposed to be
partial to, and the whole tenor of these young people's conduct gives me as much
satisfaction as I am almost sure the perusal of these papers will, as recommended by you,
I shall readily pardon what I am sorry to say has at present a great appearance of duplicity
on her part." Edward had imparted that morning, to one part of the family, the pleasing tidings
of augmented wealth; he now felt the flattering hope that he might also impart happiness
and the bright bliss of successful love to the other: alas! for himself, there threatened a
fatal cloud to obscure his peace, and now ready to burst over his head as sudden as it was
unexpected. ----------He left the nymph,

AMINTA OF TASSO
ON the return of the Reverend Mr. Marsham to his daughter's cottage, he
observed a kind of dismay seated on the countenances of the servants: on enquiry, he
found Sir Edward Harrington had ordered his horses, and departed for London with all
possible speed; promising, however, to return as soon as possible. "Had he received any special letter?" asked Mr. Marsham, for the post had arrived
long before he went out. "No," they replied, "he had been engaged with Mrs. Harrington
all the morning, as she practised an Italian air on the Spanish guitar;" and Mrs.
Harrington's footman said, "he had heard Sir Edward remark to his mistress, that he was
so sure there was not any news in the papers, he had not read them since their arrival:
when he came into the room to see to the fire, Mrs. Harrington was performing her lesson
for the third time; and he heard her say, as she looked at her watch, that it was getting so
late, she should not have time to dress herself by dinner: after she left the parlour, he saw
Sir Edward take up the newspapers, and almost immediately after ordered his horses and
departed." In a few minutes after, his servant rode back, requesting the footman of Mrs.
Harrington to give him all the newspapers; but he could not find them; and he afterwards
found they were taken out of the library, and laid on the breakfast-table, with the
directions put on them again, as Mr. Marsham saw them.-"Where is your mistress?" said Edward.-"In her dressing-room, sir," replied the servant, "where she has locked
herself in, and desired that no one may interrupt her." Edward in vain endeavoured to persuade himself that perhaps she had finished her
toilette, and might be in earnest application over some of the many accomplishments she
had to attend to; but then he felt assured, from the sudden departure of his noble guest,
after his perusal of the news, that something fatal had befallen the Harrington family. He took up the MORNING POST, he hastily skimmed it over, and reverted to his
favourite political register, the TIMES; and after he had scanned over the dearth of home
news and foreign politics contained at that time, even in this paper, and read the probable
changes in the cabinet, in which perhaps he began to imagine Sir Edward Harrington
might be personally interested, and have had some reason, on that score, for his sudden
departure; when his eye glanced on a paragraph, which he read with real anguish of mind,
and which ran nearly in the following words:


"The conduct of Lady I---- R---D has, at length, so increased in
notoriety, that after furnishing conversation for every inhabitant of Cromer, in Norfolk,
she has actually eloped with the dashing and elegant Mr. H----N, the nephew of the
rich, the excellent, and illustrious Sir E---- H-----. The injured husband,
Major R---D, a most deserving officer, had pursued the fugitives; and, with anguish
unspeakable, received ocular proofs of his wife's infidelity. What particularly aggravates
the fault of MR. H----N, is, that he has been only a few months married to a
beautiful and amiable young lady in Essex. This notorious faux-pas in the fashionable
world, it is thought, will furnish ample matter for the gentlemen of the long robe, in the
display of their oratorical talents; and no doubt enormous damages will be obtained by
Major R----D, an accomplished and handsome young man, the avowed object of
her ladyship's virgin choice, and a most affectionate and tender husband." The TIMES, when attacking characters in high life, has often had the reputation,
we will not say whether deservedly or not, of being rather libellous; but though all the late
conduct of Frederic Harrington seemed but too well to tally with this fatal news, yet, as
the drowning man will catch at a straw, so poor Edward felt a faint, alas! a very faint
glimmering of hope that this might be an exaggerated account. He recollected that the
MORNING POST was the first of all papers for fashionable intelligence; an article he
scarcely ever attended to, unless it was to deplore the expence of luxury,
"------straining her low thought,
"To form unreal wants--------"
while worthy poverty industriously laboured, and with difficulty could earn one daily
meal. He now took up this vehicle of intelligence, and eagerly glanced his anxious eye
over the miscellaneous paragraphs: he there read all, and more than the other paper had
reported; even the names were not all initialized, but boldly informed the public that
Major RAYMOND intended to apply immediately for a divorce, and had engaged the
famous Serjeant B. to plead his cause in Westminster Hall; while Mr. H. had retained for
his counsel the learned and eloquent Mr. G----. The reader was likewise informed,
through this polite channel of fashionable news, that Major Raymond, in company with a
brother-officer, after tracing the fugitives to an inn on the London road, was an eyewitness
of his own disgrace: however, this paper did not speak quite so much in favour of
the Major; it appeared rather to hint a connivance on the part of the husband, with a view
to obtain enormous damages; which connivance, if proved, would infallibly end in his
deserved disappointment, and draw on him the contempt he so amply merited. But all this
did not heal the wound inflicted by this poisoned arrow on the hearts of the worthy curate
and his daughter; neither did it extenuate Harrington's guilt. The HERALD and the COURIER gave the paragraph in much the same words as
the TIMES; but the latter made some excellent and moral reflexions on the enormity of
that crime, which is become so prevalent in this country; and particularly dwelt on the
aggravation of Mr. Harrington's fault, as being so lately married to a young lady, who had
been his fondest choice, and who, though not yet known in the great world, was allowed
to do honour to his taste, and was a pattern of amiableness, virtue, and loveliness. The heart of Edward was now in such extreme anguish, that the full tide of sorrow
which overwhelmed it burst from his eyes, and leaning his face on his hands over the fatal
newspapers, he gave way to the womanish relief of tears, unheeding of the servant, who
had told him twice that dinner was waiting, and at length gently touched his elbow to
repeat the information: he requested a glass of water to compose his agitated spirits, and
then with all the tranquillity he could assume, repaired to the dining-parlour. He there found his daughter, the image of silent woe: ever mistress of herself,
Mary had been always accustomed to conceal any agitation of mind from her servants;
but though they would never hear their master's fault from her lips, yet she well knew
concealment would be in vain in this instance. She had seated herself, with a pallid countenance, and the roseate hue, which
always embellished her cheek and lip, now only encircled her eyes; in vain she
endeavoured to eat, and appear tranquil; in vain she pressed her father to eat likewise; his
appetite, like hers, was fled, and the dinner went away almost untouched. When the servants were withdrawn, the bursting sorrow again found its way from
the sweet eyes of Mary: her father drew his chair towards her, and as she leaned forward
to return his embrace, the consolation of having such a worthy parent, the dread of adding
to his grief on her account, made her endeavour to dry her tears, and essay to impart that
comfort of which she herself stood most in need. "Be still yourself, my angel daughter," said he, as he pressed her to his fond
bosom; "perhaps your virtues, your sweetness, mingled with dignity, and void of all
clamorous reproaches, may reclaim the wanderer, and you may in the end be happy. "-
"Never!" replied Mary, with a solemn kind of assurance that she never could be so again:
"the sweet delusion is fled for ever, which taught me to think that my Frederic was mine,
and mine alone! If so soon he shews the fickleness and inconstancy of his nature, what
have I not to expect as years roll on, and the probable loss of some of these poor
attractions I possess are fled! Cheerfulness, the bright prospect of that happiness which I
constantly looked forward to in my union with Harrington, will no longer animate my
countenance, or impart lustre to my now continually weeping eyes: to cheerful vivacity,
will succeed lowering care; mistrust and jealous fears will, with my disappointed views,
cloud all my features, and render sallow that cheek which my deceiver has often kissed as
he likened it to the fresh-blown rose. I too well know the powerful and seductive charms
of my rival: supreme in beauty, as in wit and accomplishments, she possesses also that
fascination which will for ever supplant me, and stamp her image indelible on the heart of
Frederic." "Pardon me, my beloved," said Edward, "you have been, hitherto, accustomed,
with your happy disposition, to behold life in its fairest perspective; but the little worldly
knowledge you boast, has caused you, when a real misfortune assails you, to fear the
worst. I am much deceived in Mr. Harrington, if he is not now, by the influence of
modern manners, acting under a false character: for there always seemed in him, under
the painted mask of fashionable dissipation, an inward love for virtue, and oft-times a
severe reprehension of his own thoughtless conduct. Believe me, my dear one, that a man
can never long admire a woman devoid of principle, and who sets virtue at defiance as
prudish grimace." "But such a woman, surely, is not Lady Isabella Raymond," said Mary; "whom
my unhappy husband has seduced from the path of honour! "-"He seduce her?" said
Edward, with contempt; "no, no, Mary, it is she who is the seducer: and though I greatly
blame, and even detest the conduct of Mr. Harrington towards you, yet I still look forward
with hope, that a great and entire reformation will be worked in his conduct, even by this
atrocious error, and that you and your virtues will become dearer to him than ever. A
woman who breaks through all the sacred ties of conjugal duty, who to a life of honour,
decency, and decorum, prefers that of guilt, giving way to the indulgence of passion, is
never esteemed by a man after the enthusiasm of desire is grown languid by possession;
and without esteem, love is but of short duration. It is this known truth in the married
state, which renders it so essential for a man to choose his partner rather for virtue and
mental qualifications than beauty; the one he gets accustomed to-each day it fades
before his eyes; while the others increase in attraction: he esteems more and more what is
so valuable, and loves what he esteems. "-"But think, my dear sir," said Mary, "of the
wonderful abilities and accomplishments of Lady Isabella!" "Acquirements only, my dear," said Edward, "they are not the virtues of the heart
and mind; for six or seven shillings," added he, smiling, "Mr. Harrington may go to the
theatre, and behold and hear all the fascinating accomplishments of his once adored
Isabella represented on the stage, for I dare say she is no longer adored! but rather
becoming a very troublesome appendage to him. "-"But, as a man of honour," said
Mary, "he must not quit her; she can never again return to her husband's home; her
friends will not look upon her: Frederic, for whom she has sacrificed so much, must not
leave her destitute: I really think, sooner than the unhappy woman should be driven to
distress, I could grant her an asylum, and be tempted almost to act like Lady Gresham*, in
the affair of her husband and Lady Harriet Egmont." "Such conduct, I think," said her father, gravely, "is a misplaced generosity, which
borders upon want of feeling, and shews rather too much tameness in a wife. I, certainly,
as well as yourself, would not wish Mr. Harrington to leave a woman in distress, as he
has been the primary cause of her being for ever banished her husband's roof, and
despised in the eyes of the world: but she must not become an inmate in the same house
with a virtuous wife; for, in order to be truly reconciled to that injured wife, he must
never behold the partner in his crime again." It may be easily imagined that, though the excellent father often tried to converse
with his daughter on general matters, yet their discourse continually reverted to the
subject that was nearest their hearts. In the evening numerous country visitors called; but
Mrs. Harrington was not at home to any one; too well she knew the secret motive of such
visits, and found her cottage would be no place for her to remain in for the present: in
which opinion she was further strengthened the next morning by receiving the following
letter from Sir Edward Harrington to her father. "Dear and respected friend;
"WHEN I so suddenly left the hospitable home of my dear niece yesterday,
I intended shortly to have returned to it; mature reflection, however, tells me it is better
she should quit it for a time; exposed alike to a painful retrospect of past felicity, and the
* Historique


visits of impertinent curiosity, concealed under the mask of condolence, I think it best
that you repair with the dear sufferer immediately to the vicinity of London, where she
will be less known, and less liable to interruption: at the same time, actually in the
metropolis, my niece cannot reside as MRS. HARRINGTON, without subjecting herself
to be the public talk. I have, therefore, hired a pleasant, furnished little villa, on the banks
of the Thames, at Twickenham, where she may be as retired as she pleases, and see only
those few friends she wishes: yourself, I particularly desire to remain in town for a day or
two, when I will introduce you personally to the Chancellor; as I trust his Lordship will,
in a few days, put you in possession of an excellent benefice, now vacant, and in his gift. As soon as you can possibly make your arrangements for the journey, leave the
housekeeper and gardener to take charge of the cottage, and come immediately to my
house in St. James's Square, where you will be cordially and affectionately welcomed by
"Your ever true friend,
"EDWARD HARRINGTON." The Reverend Mr. Marsham and his daughter lost no time in hastening their
departure from Eglantine; a clergyman, a few miles off, consenting to perform the
parochial duty for the good curate during his absence. The bustle, the change of scene, by
employing the natural energy of Mary's mind for a few days, made her, in some degree,
forget the deep anguish which had lately assailed her; but sleepless nights, as she sought
repose on her pillow, told her that her grief only slumbered, but still existed: a sound and
heavy sleep towards morning, or flattering dreams of Frederic's constancy and fond
affection, has caused her to wake, to the sad reverse of wretchedness and tears: she has
then quickly risen, again to employ herself, and try, if possible, to fly from thought and
from herself. While an affectionate father mourned over the sorrows of a virtuous child, his
griefs were, in part, but begun; his youngest daughter had become the prey of a villain's
systematic arts, whose fugitive inclination for her person was now succeeded by disgust,
and she already experienced from him the most contemptuous neglect. Poor Margaret,
whose personal attractions scarcely approached to mediocrity, without one elegant
accomplishment to compensate for the deficiency of them; a slattern in her dress, with all
the affectation of a female pedant; was not likely long to retain the attention of a libertine
admirer: she had good-nature, sincerity, and an heart too tender; but these are poor
qualifications, when there is nothing else to be thrown into the scale to make it
preponderate. The corroding sorrow of her heart, the tears she shed in secret, by no means
contributed to heighten the very few agr�mens of person she possessed from nature; and
the wretched girl was in that state
"Which women wish to be who love their lords,"
but which Margaret was much afflicted at discovering; for when she imparted the
unwelcome news to Sir Charles, he said it was "devilish unlucky," he was "confoundedly
sorry to hear it," but "what would she have him do?" She saw him afterwards but very
seldom, and then he scarcely took any notice of her. Mrs. Davenport, inspired by rage and jealousy, accused her of her criminal
intrigue with Sir Charles Sefton; the tears and blushes of the unhappy Margaret too
plainly told the truth of what her tongue denied: and when she found the unkindness of
Mrs. Davenport increase towards her, when she hourly endured, and trembled at the
threats of that lady, to acquaint her father with her faulty conduct, she resolved on visiting
Sir Charles at his house, and endeavouring by tears and all the persuasion she was
mistress off, to intreat him to take her under his protection. Repeatedly did she make her
morning visits, while the surly porter as oft uncivilly told her his master was not at home;
and when she once urged that she saw him at the window, "Aye, child," said the porter,
"but he does not choose to be at home to you; and this is no time; his ladies always come
of an evening: not that I think," added he, looking in her face and insolently laughing,
"that he will see you! however, if you have a mind to come to-morrow night, I believe he
will be at home." Somewhat comforted to hear that there was a prospect of her seeing him on the
morrow, she went home; she knew Mrs. Davenport was going to the theatre in the
evening of the morrow, and that she should be left alone; for she now never went with her
in public. The poor girl's spirits were this day better, being rather elevated by hope; but
the behaviour of Mr. and Mrs. Davenport to her was not only rude and uncivil, but cutting
in the extreme: the trio dined together, and as they were taking their wine after, Mr.
Davenport made many animadversions on the depravity of taste; for Mr. Davenport
detested a woman, if she was not very pretty: "Oh! by heaven," said he, "any ugly devil
now may get a lover; we shall have a d--d pretty breed, I expect, in the next
generation: well, thank God, I don't suppose I shall live to see the baboons, for I'm going,
as fast as I can, to the d--l; so, Emily, you'll be a handsome dashing widow, with a
good jointure, my girl-" "Which I'll keep to myself," said the gay lady, "whenever you
kick, Davenport, depend upon it; love who I please; but marry no more; and the age is not
so nice, but many a dear soul, free as myself, will caress and visit me. "-"No, no,"
replied her husband, "you are right, Emily, the age is not nice, upon my soul! why I was
told the other day," and he glanced his eyes full upon Margaret, "that a poor yellow
