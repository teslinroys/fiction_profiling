But although I have often
since had many a good laugh at the sport, I was not overly pleased with
Mrs Pawkie at the time--particularly as the matter between the deacon's
wife and Jeanie did not end with my interlocutor. For the latheron's
friend in the court having discovered that I had not decerned she was to
do any work to Mrs Girdwood, but only to stay out her term, advised her
to do nothing when she went back but go to her bed, which she was bardy
enough to do, until my poor friend, the deacon, in order to get a quiet
riddance of her, was glad to pay her full fee, and board wages for the
remainder of her time. This was the same Jeanie Tirlet that was
transported for some misdemeanour, after making both Glasgow and
Edinburgh owre het to hold her. Shortly after the foregoing tribulation, of which I cannot take it upon
me to say that I got so well rid as of many other vexations of a more
grievous nature, there arose a thing in the town that caused to me much
deep concern, and very serious reflection. I had been, from the
beginning, a true government man, as all loyal subjects ought in duty to
be; for I never indeed could well understand how it would advantage,
either the king or his ministers, to injure and do detriment to the
lieges; on the contrary, I always saw and thought that his majesty, and
those of his cabinet, had as great an interest in the prosperity and well-
doing of the people, as it was possible for a landlord to have in the
thriving of his tenantry. Accordingly, giving on all occasions, and at
all times and seasons, even when the policy of the kingdom was overcast
with a cloud, the king and government, in church and state, credit for
the best intentions, however humble their capacity in performance might
seem in those straits and difficulties, which, from time to time,
dumfoundered the wisest in power and authority, I was exceedingly
troubled to hear that a newspaper was to be set up in the burgh, and
that, too, by hands not altogether clean of the coom of jacobinical
democracy. The person that first brought me an account of this, and it was in a
private confidential manner, was Mr Scudmyloof, the grammar schoolmaster,
a man of method and lear, to whom the fathers of the project had applied
for an occasional cast of his skill, in the way of Latin head-pieces, and
essays of erudition concerning the free spirit among the ancient Greeks
and Romans; but he, not liking the principle of the men concerned in the
scheme, thought that it would be a public service to the community at
large, if a stop could be put, by my help, to the opening of such an
ettering sore and king's evil as a newspaper, in our heretofore and
hitherto truly royal and loyal burgh; especially as it was given out that
the calamity, for I can call it no less, was to be conducted on liberal
principles, meaning, of course, in the most afflicting and vexatious
manner towards his majesty's ministers. "What ye say," said I to Mr Scudmyloof when he told me the news, "is very
alarming, very much so indeed; but as there is no law yet actually and
peremptorily prohibiting the sending forth of newspapers, I doubt it will
not be in my power to interfere." He was of the same opinion; and we both agreed it was a rank exuberance
of liberty, that the commonality should be exposed to the risk of being
inoculated with anarchy and confusion, from what he, in his learned
manner, judiciously called the predilections of amateur pretension. The
parties engaged in the project being Mr Absolom the writer--a man no
overly reverential in his opinion of the law and lords when his clients
lost their pleas, which, poor folk, was very often--and some three or
four young and inexperienced lads, that were wont to read essays, and
debate the kittle points of divinity and other hidden knowledge, in the
Cross-Keys monthly, denying the existence of the soul of man, as Dr
Sinney told me, till they were deprived of all rationality by foreign or
British spirits. In short, I was perplexed when I heard of the design,
not knowing what to do, or what might be expected from me by government
in a case of such emergency as the setting up of a newspaper so
declaredly adverse to every species of vested trust and power; for it was
easy to forsee that those immediately on the scene would be the first
opposed to the onset and brunt of the battle. Never can any public man
have a more delicate task imposed upon him, than to steer clear of
offence in such a predicament. After a full consideration of the
business, Mr Scudmyloof declared that he would retire from the field, and
stand aloof; and he rehearsed a fine passage in the Greek language on
that head, pat to the occasion, but which I did not very thoroughly
understand, being no deacon in the dead languages, as I told him at the
time. But when the dominie had left me, I considered with myself, and having
long before then observed that our hopes, when realized, are always light
in the grain, and our fears, when come to pass, less than they seemed as
seen through the mists of time and distance, I resolved with myself to
sit still with my eyes open, watching and saying nothing; and it was well
that I deported myself so prudently; for when the first number of the
paper made its appearance, it was as poor a job as ever was "open to all
parties, and influenced by none;" and it required but two eyes to discern
that there was no need of any strong power from the lord advocate to
suppress or abolish the undertaking; for there was neither birr nor
smeddum enough in it to molest the high or to pleasure the low; so being
left to itself, and not ennobled by any prosecution, as the schemers
expected, it became as foisonless as the "London Gazette" on ordinary
occasions. Those behind the curtain, who thought to bounce out with a
grand stot and strut before the world, finding that even I used it as a
convenient vehicle to advertise my houses when need was, and which I did
by the way of a canny seduction of policy, joking civilly with Mr Absolom
anent his paper trumpet, as I called it, they were utterly vanquished by
seeing themselves of so little account in the world, and forsook the
thing altogether; by which means it was gradually transformed into a very
solid and decent supporter of the government--Mr Absolom, for his pains,
being invited to all our public dinners, of which he gave a full account,
to the great satisfaction of all who were present, but more particularly
to those who were not, especially the wives and ladies of the town, to
whom it was a great pleasure to see the names of their kith and kin in
print. And indeed, to do Mr Absolom justice, he was certainly at great
pains to set off every thing to the best advantage, and usually put
speeches to some of our names which showed that, in the way of
grammaticals, he was even able to have mended some of the parliamentary
clishmaclavers, of which the Londoners, with all their skill in the
craft, are so seldom able to lick into any shape of common sense. Thus, by a judicious forbearance in the first instance, and a canny
wising towards the undertaking in the second, did I, in the third, help
to convert this dangerous political adversary into a very respectable
instrument of governmental influence and efficacy. The spirit of opposition that kithed towards me in the affair of Robin
Boss, the drummer, was but an instance and symptom of the new nature then
growing up in public matters. I was not long done with my second
provostry, when I had occasion to congratulate myself on having passed
twice through the dignity with so much respect; for, at the Michaelmas
term, we had chosen Mr Robert Plan into the vacancy caused by the death
of that easy man, Mr Weezle, which happened a short time before. I know
not what came over me, that Mr Plan was allowed to be chosen, for I never
could abide him; being, as he was, a great stickler for small
particularities, more zealous than discreet, and even more intent to
carry his own point, than to consider the good that might flow from a
more urbane spirit. Not that the man was devoid of ability--few, indeed,
could set forth a more plausible tale; but he was continually meddling,
keeking, and poking, and always taking up a suspicious opinion of every
body's intents and motives but his own. He was, besides, of a retired
and sedentary habit of body; and the vapour of his stomach, as he was
sitting by himself, often mounted into his upper story, and begat, with
his over zealous and meddling imagination, many unsound and fantastical
notions. For all that, however, it must be acknowledged that Mr Plan was
a sincere honest man, only he sometimes lacked the discernment of the
right from the wrong; and the consequence was, that, when in error, he
was even more obstinate than when in the right; for his jealousy of human
nature made him interpret falsely the heat with which his own headstrong
zeal, when in error, was ever very properly resisted. In nothing, however, did his molesting temper cause so much disturbance,
as when, in the year 1809, the bigging of the new school-house was under
consideration. There was, about that time, a great sough throughout the
country on the subject of education, and it was a fashion to call schools
academies; and out of a delusion rising from the use of that term, to
think it necessary to decry the good plain old places, wherein so many
had learnt those things by which they helped to make the country and
kingdom what it is, and to scheme for the ways and means to raise more
edificial structures and receptacles. None was more infected with his
distemperature than Mr Plan; and accordingly, when he came to the council-
chamber, on the day that the matter of the new school-house was to be
discussed, he brought with him a fine castle in the air, which he pressed
hard upon us; representing, that if we laid out two or three thousand
pounds more than we intended, and built a beautiful academy and got a
rector thereto, with a liberal salary, and other suitable masters,
opulent people at a distance--yea, gentlemen in the East and West
Indies--would send their children to be educated among us, by which,
great fame and profit would redound to the town. Nothing could be more plausibly set forth; and certainly the project, as
a notion, had many things to recommend it; but we had no funds adequate
to undertake it; so, on the score of expense, knowing, as I did, the
state of the public income, I thought it my duty to oppose it _in toto_;
which fired Mr Plan to such a degree, that he immediately insinuated that
I had some end of my own to serve in objecting to his scheme; and because
the wall that it was proposed to big round the moderate building, which
we were contemplating, would inclose a portion of the backside of my new
steading at the Westergate, he made no scruple of speaking, in a
circumbendibus manner, as to the particular reasons that I might have for
preferring it to his design, which he roused, in his way, as more worthy
of the state of the arts and the taste of the age. It was not easy to sit still under his imputations; especially as I could
plainly see that some of the other members of the council leant towards
his way of thinking. Nor will I deny that, in preferring the more
moderate design, I had a contemplation of my own advantage in the matter
of the dyke; for I do not think it any shame to a public man to serve his
own interests by those of the community, when he can righteously do so. It was a thing never questionable, that the school-house required the
inclosure of a wall, and the outside of that wall was of a natural
necessity constrained to be a wing of inclosure to the ground beyond. Therefore, I see not how a corrupt motive ought to have been imputed to
me, merely because I had a piece of ground that marched with the spot
whereon it was intended to construct the new building; which spot, I
should remark, belonged to the town before I bought mine. However, Mr
Plan so worked upon this material, that, what with one thing and what
with another, he got the council persuaded to give up the moderate plan,
and to consent to sell the ground where it had been proposed to build the
new school, and to apply the proceeds towards the means of erecting a
fine academy on the Green. It was not easy to thole to be so thwarted, especially for such an
extravagant problem, by one so new to our councils and deliberations. I
never was more fashed in my life; for having hitherto, in all my plans
for the improvement of the town, not only succeeded, but given
satisfaction, I was vexed to see the council run away with such a
speculative vagary. No doubt, the popular fantasy anent education and
academies, had quite as muckle to do in the matter as Mr Plan's fozey
rhetoric, but what availed that to me, at seeing a reasonable undertaking
reviled and set aside, and grievous debts about to be laid on the
community for a bubble as unsubstantial as that of the Ayr Bank. Besides,
it was giving the upper hand in the council to Mr Plan, to which, as a
new man, he had no right. I said but little, for I saw it would be of no
use; I, however, took a canny opportunity of remarking to old Mr
Dinledoup, the English teacher, that this castle-building scheme of an
academy would cause great changes probably in the masters; and as, no
doubt, it would oblige us to adopt the new methods of teaching, I would
like to have a private inkling of what salary he would expect on being
superannuated. The worthy man was hale and hearty, not exceeding three score and seven,
and had never dreamt of being superannuated. He was, besides, a prideful
body, and, like all of his calling, thought not a little of himself. The
surprise, therefore, with which he heard me was just wonderful. For a
space of time he stood still and uttered nothing; then he took his snuff-
box out of the flap pocket of his waistcoat, where he usually carried it,
and, giving three distinct and very comical raps, drew his mouth into a
purse. "Mr Pawkie," at last he said; "Mr Pawkie, there will be news in
the world before I consent to be superannuated." This was what I expected, and I replied, "Then, why do not you and Mr
Scudmyloof, of the grammar school, represent to the magistrates that the
present school-house may, with a small repair, serve for many years." And
so I sowed an effectual seed of opposition to Mr Plan, in a quarter he
never dreamt of; the two dominies, in the dread of undergoing some
transmogrification, laid their heads together, and went round among the
parents of the children, and decried the academy project, and the cess
that the cost of it would bring upon the town; by which a public opinion
was begotten and brought to a bearing, that the magistrates could not
resist; so the old school-house was repaired, and Mr Plan's scheme, as
well as the other, given up. In this, it is true, if I had not the
satisfaction to get a dyke to the backside of my property, I had the
pleasure to know that my interloping adversary was disappointed; the
which was a sort of compensation. The general election in 1812 was a source of trouble and uneasiness to
me; both because our district of burghs was to be contested, and because
the contest was not between men of opposite principles, but of the same
side. To neither of them had I any particular leaning; on the contrary,
I would have preferred the old member, whom I had, on different
occasions, found an accessible and tractable instrument, in the way of
getting small favours with the government and India company, for friends
that never failed to consider them as such things should be. But what
could I do? Providence had placed me in the van of the battle, and I
needs must fight; so thought every body, and so for a time I thought
myself. Weighing, however, the matter one night soberly in my mind, and
seeing that whichever of the two candidates was chosen, I, by my adherent
loyalty to the cause for which they were both declared, the contest
between them being a rivalry of purse and personality, would have as much
to say with the one as with the other, came to the conclusion that it was
my prudentest course not to intermeddle at all in the election. Accordingly, as soon as it was proper to make a declaration of my
sentiments, I made this known, and it caused a great wonderment in the
town; nobody could imagine it possible that I was sincere, many thinking
there was something aneath it, which would kithe in time to the surprise
of the public.
