my love,"
added she, lowering her voice, "I have much to impart to a congenial soul like yours!" At
the same time her ladyship looked on the lovely Mary with not only an haughty sang
froid, but even with a degree of spite; and composed of those expressive characteristics,
Lady Isabella's countenance was the direct index of her mind: for so much did she know
of that grand theatre, the world; so often did she make one in the high and splendid circles
of festivity, that she easily saw, since her last visit to Eglantine farm, how much the form
and face of the then promising Mary was improved, and that she was in full possession of
that fascination, that unobtruding, though playful expression, which would decidedly give
her a preference with all the males wherever she appeared. Lady Isabella was sure to be admired; but she had often, not only competitors, but
superiors in personal attractions to contend with; this made her carefully improve her
talent for wit, in order to render herself irresistible: yet Lady Isabella, by wearing this
dangerous weapon, defeated her purpose; she was sometimes so cuttingly severe, that
with all the smiling witchery of her countenance, she has been thought ill-natured, and
consequently shunned; at other times she has felt herself low-spirited, and her efforts at
saying smart things (in which she was sure to fail, for all wit should be spontaneous) has
caused her to be classed only amongst the would-be-witty triflers of quality. Margaret, at the flattering address of her ladyship, let fall her eyelids, and timidly
lifted them again; and while she endeavoured to express, by her eyes, every thing that was


sweet and lovely, she gave them a turn very much like that defect which we call
squinting; and smiling, as she was forming a speech to express her gratitude for the
honour done her, she shewed the ruins of her mouth, and Lady Isabella with great
difficulty suppressed her laughter. Lady Caroline looked at her diminutive gold watch, and found it was getting late; she
had laid an enormous bet upon what time the morning sun would be off the last window
of the dining-parlour, and she must absolutely be present at the decision: she therefore
instantly rose, and took her leave of the good family with a condescending and protecting
air. Lady Isabella again whispered Margaret, and told her how much she longed for
Thursday! gave Charles a familiar nod; a knowing quizzical curtsey to Ralph; and with a
bow full of grace and sweetness, pressed her hand to her heart, and regarded Edward, as
he opened the parlour-door for the polite visitants. The Reverend Mr. Leslie seemed to take leave of no one but Mary, gave her a very
particular look, and sighed audibly. And now the maitre d'h�tel of Lady Caroline, the house-keeper, and all the upper
servants were busied in displaying their taste, and making a most ample use of the purse
and credit of their master, in each of which they were lavish to a degree of prodigality;
while the subaltern servants were busied in every laborious preparation for the grand gala
of the approaching Thursday. Nor were the girls at the farm-house less occupied in arranging their dresses for the
occasion; and though Margaret was most wakeful for the important cause, yet we will not
say that Mary had so little of the female in her, as not to lay awake some quarter of an
hour or more each night, in reckoning upon that elegant pleasure in perspective which she
so seldom enjoyed, and which delightful vision would, no doubt, be realised amongst
such a splendid circle. Oh youth! delightful season of pleasure, enhanced by expectation! why are thy hours so fleeting? Why, in the stages of maturity, and even in high meridian,
does the sparkling cup, so lately sweetened with felicity, present a draft so insipid? and
why stands age so ready and unsolicited to throw in her bitter and unpalatable
ingredients? Rash mortal, cease to murmur-wise and beneficent, O Providence, are all
thy decrees! the ardour and error of youth is chastened by the still and tranquil pleasures
of mature experience and in age the recollection of good deeds performed in the earlier
stages of life will turn the noxious draught to sweetness and composure. Up springs the dance along the lighted dome,
Mix'd, and evolv'd, a thousand sprightly ways. THOMSON. ----------On her rankled soul
The gaming fury falls; and in one gulph
Of total ruin; honour, virtue, peace,
Friends, families, and fortune, headlong sink. Ibid. ON the long expected Thursday, rather too soon, with shame we confess it, at the
hour of five, a full hour or more before dinner, arrived at the parsonage Mr. Marsham and
his suite, consisting of his brothers and nieces: the footman gazed at them with wonder as
he ushered them into the spacious drawing-room, and said, he would inform his lady of
their arrival, but she had just then retired to dress after her morning's game at piquet with
Mr. Harrington; and his master had not yet returned from his accustomed walk: Mrs.
Kennedy was not even at leisure to receive them, as she was finishing the last stanza of a
sonnet to Cupid, before she could possibly attend to the frivolous duties of the toilette. However, after the Marsham family had been seated about half an hour, down came Lady
Isabella, in a loose, wrapping, muslin pelisse; her hair, on one side, in beautiful ringlets,
en papillotes on the other. "This is the abode of liberty," said she gaily, "and I am come
en vrai deshabille to welcome you all: but, permit me, while I put the finishing hand to
my toilette, to take my sweet girl with me." But as her ladyship turned to make Charles
Marsham some answer to an handsome compliment which he paid her, she took the hand
of Mary, instead of Margaret, and running with her up the wide staircase, said to her, "My
dearest creature, how I have longed for to-day!" when turning to embrace her, she
discovered her mistake, and felt almost ready to push poor Mary down the stairs;
however, she put a good face upon the matter, and said, with all the good humour she
could assume, "but pray, child, where is your sister? Why did not she follow us? It must
be more pleasant for you both to stay with me in my apartment till I am dressed, than be
with your father and uncles; you have enough of them every day!" "Your ladyship does us honour," said Mary, "and with your permission, I will desire
my sister to come up stairs. "-"Do, my dear," said her ladyship, "but do not let me
confine you, do not come up again unless you like it." Mary had sense enough to see that Lady Isabella did not wish for her company; and
also that, from what motive she knew not, she gave a decided preference to her sister; but
at this the good-natured girl rather rejoiced than repined. She not only loved to see her sister noticed, but she also found Lady Isabella by no
means of a character to excite either her respect or regard; she tripped down stairs again,
but not having minded, in her ascent, which way she had turned, she took a contrary


direction when she descended, and instead of finding herself in the drawing-room, she
discovered she had entered a long apartment, decorated with coloured lamps and various
devices, in which an elegant cold supper was laid out on the several tables. She quitted it immediately, without staying to admire its tasteful abundance, and
opened the third door from this spacious apartment: a young gentleman, half dressed, and
reading a pamphlet, met her eye; he regarded her with peculiar interest, and advanced
forward with a polite freedom, mingled with respect and trepidation (for Mary had
imparted to Frederic Harrington
"A new pulse, unfelt before");
"Permit me, madam," said he, in a tremulous accent, as he observed the deep
confusion of Mary, to which he was fearful of adding, "permit me to conduct you to the
drawing-room. If you will pardon," added he, "the grotesque appearance of such an halfdressed
escort, I will do myself the honour of leading you to your friends; for I am much
deceived," continued he, as they walked onwards, "if it is not Miss Marsham whom I now
have the honour of addressing!" The charming and polite ease of Harrington now entirely relieved Mary from her
embarrassment, and she chatted with all the unrestrained and charming na�vet�, which
was her peculiar characteristic. With all the vivacity and heedlessness of youth, she had not observed that she had
turned down another staircase than that on which she had ascended to the apartment of
Lady Isabella, and was soon made sensible of her mistake, as she took her way with
Frederic to that leading to the drawing-room; on which flight of stairs, having descended
a few steps, Lady Isabella now accosted her, in a voice almost unintelligible from rage
and jealousy-"Is your sister, Miss Marsham, coming up, or no?" "I have not yet seen her, my lady," said Mary, with the most tranquil innocence. "Where then, in the name of heaven, have you been?" said her ladyship; and without
waiting for an answer she banged the door of her apartment with violence, and threw
herself on an ottomane in all the agony of jealousy. Several minutes had elapsed, each of which had seemed an age to the wretched
Isabella, since Mary left her-she had descended two or three stairs to see if Margaret
was coming; the first objects that met her eye, were Harrington and Mary! Harrington in
his dressing-gown, the powder only half wiped from his face, his feet in slippers, his
animated and expressive eyes fixed on the countenance of Mary, who regarded him with
more than common complacency. "Shall such a little rustic wretch as that," thought she,
"dare to enter the lists with me, and contend for the heart of the charming Frederic? Never-no, never, without feeling the weight of my severest vengeance." During these reflections of the lady, Harrington had nearly reached the drawing-room
door, towards which he waved his disengaged hand, and bowing elegantly over the soft
one which he held in his, took his leave; while Mary, giving a gentle sigh, secretly
thought he had left her too soon. Lady Isabella, her cheeks glowing with agitation, and her heart palpitating with
various emotions, reclined on her ottomane, awaiting the arrival of Margaret; what to
make of the scene she had witnessed she knew not: Mary had not reached the drawing-


room since she left her; she had seen her in the company of Frederic, and looking more
charmingly attractive than she had thought her capable of: but the deshabille of
Harrington was a mystery she could not account for; he who was so careful in general of
his exterior appearance; she had beheld his half-powdered face rivetted as close as
decorum would permit to that of the visibly gratified Mary. "Oh!" thought she, "these
country girls are so full of intrigue, with all their pretended innocence, that no doubt this
seemingly accidental meeting was planned, and Frederic and that little puss have been
long acquainted-and shall Isabella Emerson stand forth as a rival competitor with that
obscure little creature? No, never! From this moment I cast the mean-spirited Harrington
from my heart, and I should not care if I was to marry Sir Charles Sefton to-morrow! "-
Presently, at the glad summons she had received from her ladyship, entered Margaret in
tears, which she had silently shed, as she affected to look out of a window ever since,
what she thought, the caprice of quality had deprived her of the fair Isabella's affections,
and had given her sister the preference. The negligent posture of the afflicted lady, the Turkish lit de repos on which she had
thrown her lovely form, made the fertile brain of Margaret fancy herself in a Turkish
harem; and falling on her knees, she was about to prostrate her face to the ground, when
Lady Isabella, raising her up, said, "My sweet, dear girl, what is the matter? Why these
tears? Are you, like me, a fellow-sufferer? and does thy gentle and susceptible heart feel
the pangs of unrequited love?" Margaret now recollected where she was, and said, "Is it possible, that the beautiful
Lady Isabella can sigh for any one in vain? Such, my dear lady, I trust is not my lot: but I
wept, because you honoured me with your friendship and promised confidence: alas! I
dreaded lest my sister had stepped in to rival me in the place I hold in your affections. "-
"Never, my dear girl," replied Lady Isabella, with violence and energy; "Oh! sit down,
and I will tell you all. "-But the first dinner-bell ringing, delayed the important
confidence for the present; and Lady Isabella flying to her toilette, found, from the glow
on her cheeks, that she must rub off all her rouge, if she did not wish to appear as
vulgarly red as a country milk-maid. This did not well accord with the romantic ideas of
Margaret; all the heroines she had ever read of, were indebted to nature alone for their
miraculous beauty; however, she knew but little of fashionable life, and thought every
thing that was practised by her quality friend must be right. When the two ladies entered the drawing-room together, they found it filled by the
sociable and friendly party which were selected, sans ceremonie, to partake of the
Rector's sumptuous dinner; amongst whom were the rich Sir John Wringham and his
lady: but Lady Isabella cast round her anxious eyes, and found one of the dinner-party
was yet wanting; this was the culprit Harrington: and she now, with all the negligence of
unfeeling fashion left her new friend to shift for herself; and amidst the "how d'ye's," and
"what a warm day this is, &c. &c." as she imparted that important intelligence to each
one separately, she appeared not even to know that her beloved confidante was in the
room: at length she threw herself into a kind of recess, where a t�te-�-t�te conversationchair
offered a vacant place: Sir Charles Sefton half rose to occupy it, but she almost
killed him by a frown, and sent her enquiring eye towards the door, where yet stood the
timid Margaret; but the poor girl was totally unnoticed by her, for her eye sought
Harrington only, and Margaret durst not take courage to cross the apartment, in order to


take the vacant seat by her ladyship. Lady Isabella, however, soon gave a knowing look to
Sir Charles, and spelt with her fingers, on the trimming of her sleeve, the word "QUIZ!" Sir Charles rose immediately: "Lovely creature," half-whispered he to Margaret,
"permit me to hand you to a seat;" and placing himself behind her chair, he poured forth
such a volley of hyperbolical, ridiculous compliments, that had not the mind of Margaritta
been weak in the extreme, she must have been convinced that the noble Baronet was only
diverting himself at her expence: in the mean time all the gaity of Lady Isabella seemed to
return at the mischievous sport; but whenever she cast her eyes on Mary, and beheld how
captivating she looked, anger and envy clouded her features; and it was severally
remarked, either inwardly, or by the different duos round the room, to each other, how
very ill Lady Isabella Emerson looked! Presently the door opened, and Harrington, the elegant Harrington, his person
adorned with all the auxiliaries of tasteful and gentleman-like dress, entered the room! every eye was turned towards him; but Mary cast hers down, blushed and trembled, yet
she knew not why. With a grace and ease peculiar to himself, he addressed them all, and was strongly
tempted to take the vacant seat by the side of Mary, who was placed by Lady Wringham
on a sofa pour trois; but,
"Still the world prevail'd, and its dread laugh,
"Which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn,"
prevailed, for Frederic had the world's pride amongst his several foibles; he thought it
would degrade him conspicuously to notice the proteg�e niece of a farmer, the daughter
only of a country curate! He therefore, with little deliberation, took his corner in the recess, by the gratified
Lady Isabella, and never turned his head once towards Mary, while her eyes often
unconsciously wandered towards the seat he filled. Margaret was in high spirits at her
imaginary conquest, and all seemed pleased but Mary, who was doomed to endure the
conversation and ignorant remarks of Lady Wringham, who declared to the Reverend Mr.
Marsham, "If she had no little ones, how happy she should be in having sitch a
companion always to live with her as Miss!" It now wanted a quarter of an hour to six; "The hour," said Lady Caroline, "we
generally dine at in the country; though I declare I have no appetite till eight, my usual
hour in town." "Well!" said Lady Wringham, "for my part, I always dines at three; and I thinks that a
wery good hour! but every one to their liking; ar'nt I right, Mr. Leslie?" "I am so partial to your ladyship," said the Reverend Theodore Leslie, "that I think
all you do must be right; and henceforth I should like to dine at three myself, that I might
think that you and I were, at least in one action, employed alike." "La! well, I declare you are sitch a funny man, Mr. Leslie: well, I declare, my love,"
continued she, addressing Sir John, "if our parson is not absolutely making love to me." "Mr. Leslie, lovey, does you and me much honour, I am sure," said the little man of
four-feet-eight, rising and bowing profoundly. "Well, but do you know," said his talkative rib, "if I ha'n't been talking politics here
with our curate and the captain his brother!" "Yes," said Charles, "this good lady has been rejoicing with us, that the little usurper
is at last likely to meet his deserts." "Oh! I don't know," said the Honourable and Reverend Theodore Leslie, who was
always fond of argument and contradiction, "I yet think,-mind-I by no means desire
it,-au contraire, I assure you, but I do really think that Boney will beat them all at last. My dear fellow, he has such armies, it is utterly impossible to conquer him. "-"Upon my
soul, sir," said Charles, with some warmth, "I am very sorry to hear any Englishman say
so; particularly any one who ranks high in life: in the first place, it looks as if they wished
the villain to prosper, for, as the old song says,
"What we wish to be true, we are apt to believe;"
and in the next instance, a noble and wealthy man must be extremely weak to wish it, as
the success of Buonaparte must, in the end, prove the destruction of all the rich and titled
men in Europe." The fashionable Mr. Leslie turned on his heel, and only laughed at the energy of the
honest Lieutenant, who turning to Lady Wringham, near to whom he was seated in a chair
by her sofa, said, "By heavens, I should like to see that Buonaparte tortured for a
twelvemonth! "-"And sarve him right," replied his fair companion. "Pray," squeaked Mrs. Kennedy across the room, addressing the Reverend Edward
Marsham, "have you read Coelebs in search of a Wife?" "Yes, madam," replied the curate. "And what is your opinion of it?" said the authoress. "I revere the fair author," said Edward, "and all her moral and excellent works; but I
must say, for a work of fiction, I think it too religious." All the company turned their attention from their own frivolous and general
conversation, to look at Edward Marsham.-"Well," said Lady Wringham, "and that
remark from a clergyman! who'd have thought it?" "Yes, madam," said Edward, "I repeat it, if I find a moral and religious work, I ought
certainly, according to my profession, to prefer the perusal of it to a modern novel-but a
religious book is one thing-a modern novel is another!" "Well, la! who doesn't know that?" said Lady Wringham, winking on the company,
and laughing aloud; but finding her wit unnoticed, and Lady Isabella (whose depth of
understanding and erudition approached to abstruseness), listening to the curate with
profound attention, she suffered him to continue. "Let the writers of the modern novels," said he, "like the excellent Richardson,
Fielding, and Smollett, hold up a faithful picture of the times they live in; lash vice, in
whatever shape it may appear, and applaud virtue in every-one, while they make their
heroes not demi-gods, but mere erring men; and let them, like those incomparable
authors, intersperse their works with only those few religious sentiments, which may
serve to shew the orthodoxy of their own principles, and prove to their readers, that there
is no trust to be placed on mere moral rectitude and philosophy, without the aid of
Omnipotence: these serious interspersions, if I may be allowed the term, are quite


sufficient for a work which is only meant to unbend and recreate the mind; and make
those read who are not fond, naturally, of study; and who, if they find these works too
serious, will close the book, not read at all, or else fly to the dangerous rubbish of
licentious publications. In devotion's closet let me read the immortal works of a
Tillotson, a Sherlock, and a Young; but let not such divine breathings as theirs find their
way into a tale composed from fancy, or the fertility of imagination." "And so then," said Mrs. Kennedy, "you really do not like Coelebs. "-"Pardon me,"
said Edward, "I cannot but like it; but I speak only of the proper discrimination which an
author ought to make in those kind of works; in regard to the theological part of Coelebs,
few females are so instructed as to be capable of defining religion so abstrusely as the fair
author has done."-"Oh!" interrupted the Rector, "I dare say she was helped by her good
friend, the Right Reverend the Bish-" "Hush! my good fellow, now do," said Sir
Charles Sefton, familiarly laying his hand on Mr. Leslie's mouth, "no scandal, you know I
abominate it. "-"O dear, yes," said Lady Isabella, "besides, what my brother alludes to,"
continued she, with a drawling voice, and arch look, "was so purely platonic*!" "Well, it is wonderful," said Mrs. Kennedy, "how these pretty female authors do get
on: now, pray tell me, what is there in Mrs. Fielding's works, the new authoress, who is
succeeding so rapidly? She has scarce any education, and has nothing but a fine person, a
kind of eloquence and a dashing appearance to recommend her. "*
"Where does the divine creature live?" said Sir Charles, "cannot you introduce me to
her? "-"Not I, indeed," said the mortified and much nettled Mrs. Kennedy, who had
formerly received from the quizzing Sir Charles a copious dose of flattery, but having
thrown out hints to Margaret that he suspected her of witchcraft, he found he must flatter
no one but that credulous girl for the remainder of the day, who trembled every time Mrs.
Kennedy approached her, for fear she should cast some spell around her. "When you speak of the influence of the person," said the mischievous Lady Isabella,
"I am sure no one is more obliged to nature than my dear little friend Kennedy, who has
that irresistible je ne sais quoi in her toute ensemble, that she captivates as much by her
person as by the superior brilliancy of her talents." "I am not very competent to give my judgement on books," said Charles Marsham,
"but I must say, that I think Mrs. Fielding's works, like herself, are charming; and there is
many a learned fool who pens his dry and obscure lines, which no one has patience to
read through; while the merit of an author, in my opinion, must be in knowing how to
make use of those divine gifts of natural judgement and fine ideas of the soul, which all
the logic and learning of the schools can never bestow; but if a woman unites to these
great unacquired talents, a fine person, then she is always envied by her own sex,
especially by the deformed and ugly." And at the same time he fixed his darting and angry
eyes on Mrs. Kennedy. Charles had one defect in his demeanour, which was, that when provoked, he was apt
to be personal: the conversation was getting rather acrid, but was sweetened by the
ringing of the last dinner-bell; and each gentleman taking a lady by the hand to conduct
her to the dining-parlour, the Rector seized that of Mary, drew her back, that they might
be the last of the party, and pressed the hand he held, unseen, with ardour to his lips,
before he quitted it, then seated her beside himself at the table: Lady Wringham was
*Historique. disappointed, tossed her head, and audibly uttered a "well, indeed!-for my part-." However, the excellent cheer with which the table abounded, soon restored the lady's
good humour, and by the ample credit she did to it, she proved her appetite to be as
complaisant at six o'clock as at three. Little Sir John put on his spectacles, and never took
his eyes off his plate till he had dispatched all he was helped to. Edward, doomed to the side of Mrs. Kennedy, supported with her, during the
intervals of eating, a pedantic conversation: the lady's discourse consisted of quotations
from Johnson and other learned authors; she enlarged also, in turn, on the rapacity of
booksellers, the justness of the Critical Reviewers, and the Esopian title of author,
seemed literally tacked to her back. Sir Charles Sefton, seated opposite to Lady Isabella, contemplated her beauty with
infinite satisfaction, while he poured the soft nonsense into the listening ear of Margaret,
which he wished to address to her ladyship. Harrington looked all that could express
admiration and the soft sentiments of a rising passion, whenever he glanced towards
Mary; but the deceived Isabella triumphed over her, and thought that by his unremitting
attentions and fine speeches to herself, that she was the sole mistress of his affections. The Rector took but little public notice of Mary, but now and then stole an amorous
whisper, while he gently pressed his knee against her's: her bashful embarrassment
heightened her attractions; and Harrington made a sad digression from the rules of
attentive politeness, by not hearing the dashing Lady Caroline challenge him to take a
glass of Madeira with her; for totally deaf to her ladyship, he bent forward and requested
Miss Marsham to honour him by taking one with him. Seated on each side of Lady Caroline were Sir Edward Harrington and honest Ralph,
while Charles was again in the comfortless situation of being placed by the illiterate Lady
Wringham: however, his fair partner on the other side of him, Lady Isabella, made him
some amends by her polite attentions, her sprightly jeu d' esprits, and all the fascination
of highly polished manners; nor could Charles resist the temptation of her arch wit, but
joined with her in silently quizzing the ci-devant laundress. The ladies retired soon after dinner to receive the numerous guests who had come
from the village of Eglantine and its various environs, for about the compass of ten miles,
and bade fair to make up a tolerable set for dancing: the gentlemen in the dining-parlour,
though not all dancers, promised very shortly to join the female party at their coffee. Sir Edward Harrington drew his seat near the worthy Curate, and placing Ralph on
the other side of him, he cordially took an hand of each, while he filled his own glass and
those of the three brothers, to the health of the Misses Marsham: Frederic, who thought of
no other Miss Marsham than Mary, devoutly kissed the glass as he raised it to his lip. "I'll
be shot," says the Rector, who was now well flushed with wine, "if I do not fill an
additional bumper to the health of the eldest Miss Marsham in particular;" and rising, he
cried aloud,-"To MARY! huzza!-to MARY! with three cheers!" "Pardon me, sir," said
Frederic Harrington, gravely, "the name of Miss Marsham, though it may excite homage,
yet should never be toasted with such bacchanalian applause." Mr. Leslie, who had that
morning borrowed a good round sum of the good-natured Frederic, sat down again,
saying, "Well, do as you please; but, by heaven, Marsham, if I was single, your daughter
Mary should be your Rector's wife tomorrow." Edward forced a smile, and bowing, said, "You do me too much honour, sir;" and
then turning towards Sir Edward Harrington, gave a turn to a conversation which was
becoming painful to him, by introducing his favourite subject of politics.
