"Ah! Madam! I soon saw
the cloven foot; but though I am poor I am honest; and no man in England should tempt
me to wrong the poor man above stairs. But the Frenchman! only to think of his
impudence. Ah! my very blood boils at the bare mention of it; however," said she, after a
few moments pause, "I never breathed a word of this before, even to my own dear
William, but somehow, Madam, you looked so good and so kind, that I was fain to tell
you all. "You need not repent your confidence," said Mary; "indeed, you have conferred
an obligation on me, by letting me into the character of this foreigner. I hope he has
ceased to annoy you!" "I hope so, Ma'am; I shewed him that I had some share of spirit, and that I could
feel an insult, although I was only the wife of a poor carpenter. And I declared that, if he
persisted in molesting me, I would go to the Villa, and complain of him to Miss
Moreton.-This had a good effect; it is only virtue that is bold, Ma'am. If you could but
have seen how he shrunk down, and fawned, and, spaniel-like, was for licking my hand,
by offering hush-money!-I thank my God, with only a few shillings in the house, and
not knowing where to look for more, I had the grace to refuse it; he has never been here
since, and I hope he never will again." "I hope not," said Mary, rising; "your story has deeply interested me, and I
sincerely wish it was in my power to be of real service to you, but I am an orphan relative
of Miss Moreton, placed under her care till I become of age. I hope I shall be able to call
on you frequently, and that I shall soon hear of your husband's entire recovery; you have
my best wishes;" and, modestly putting half a guinea into the little hand of the infant,
Mary waited not to see Sarah Jervis's looks, or to hear her thanks, but ran out of the
cottage, and across the common, and glided, like a sylph, into the park, where, slackening
her pace to take breath, she mentally reviewed the simple story which had just been
recited to her. "And as he view'd her ardent o'er and o'er,
"Love, Gratitude, and Pity, wept at once." THOMSON. ALL that Mary Cuthbert had just heard had but confirmed the fears which she had
previously entertained of Miss Moreton's character; though she could not have suspected
that her eccentricities were carried so far, or that she had utterly discarded all that was
regular and respectable, and had so widely outstepped the modesty of nature. The licentious and unprincipled Chevalier was at once the object of her fear and
her abhorrence; and she shrunk within herself at the idea of associating and being on
terms of apparent intimacy with a being of his stamp. "Along the cool sequester'd vale of life
"To keep the even tenor of my way
is no longer allowed me," sighed Mary. "I am drawn from my humble retirement; and,
though I am still in a subordinate station, yet am I exposed to all the dangers and the
unpleasantries of a promiscuous society; but let me trust in thee my God.-
"Then, though thou should'st wrap me in clouds,
"And threaten the hill with a storm;
"Yet the sunshine of peace shall break forth,
"And the summit reflect its last ray. "*
This pious quotation seemed to infuse new cheerfulness over her mind; and she
was again regaling her eyes with the beauties of nature, when she was startled at hearing a
small gate fall of a shrubbery, which led towards the house; and the next moment
Montgomery appeared before her. "Miss Cuthbert," said he, "how I rejoice at this accidental encounter! I will not
say, I am surprised at it; but I am flattered at thinking that a similarity of sentiment has led
us both to admire the beauties of such a morning as this." "This park is very delightfully situated," said Mary, returning Montgomery's
compliment by a modest curtesy; "if I was Miss Moreton, I should spend a great part of
my time in it." "Suppose then," said Montgomery, "that you were to lengthen your walk a little,
and return by the shrubbery, which is a more circuitous route than the one you were
taking-You will then be soon enough for breakfast; for Miss Moreton herself is to
favour us with her company at that repast, and had given an hour's grace to all the
slothful, at the moment when I quitted the house." "I think some of the party require a little indulgence after their late vigils," said
Mary, laughing. * Miss Bowdler's edition of poems, by a young lady deceased. "What do you mean?" asked Montgomery, with quickness. "Only, that Mr. Germ,
in the pursuit of owls and bats, invaded my territories a little last night, and broke my
window with a large battledore." "And he frightened you, of course?" said Montgomery. "I am almost ashamed to confess how much," answered Mary; "my spirits were in an
agitable state, I believe. However, laughter succeeded apprehension, when a light was
brought me, and I recognised the imbecile instrument of my fear lying on the floor, and
heard the simple and ludicrous account which the house maid gave of Mr. Germ's
nocturnal pursuits. "-"It is almost incredible," said Montgomery, "that man, who is
formed with faculties which capacitate him for a wide field of study and investigation,
should thus confine himself to the contemplation of a moth and a spider. He neglects the
admiration of the great universe, for the dissection of a butterfly; and stifles all the social
and companionable qualities, in dry dissertations on the dry shell of a cockle. Such is the
mischief of a ruling passion! for except with regard to his insects and his reptiles, Germ
appears to me the mere drone of his own hive, and one of the most stupid and absent
creatures that I have ever seen!" "Except Mr. Copy," said Mary, with some archness. "I will not except even Copy," said Montgomery, with equal archness; and,
looking at her, "in as much as I consider the contemplation of the "human face divine" to
be a sublimer study than that of the gnat or the flea. Painting is a noble employment-it
speaks to the soul-it moves the passions-it warms the heart! When we behold generous
actions pourtrayed on canvas; when we see the benign countenance of an hero; he seems
to live again; he is brought to our mental as well as to our corporeal vision, and we feel as
if we were participating in his emotion, whilst we are only looking at his mimic
resemblance!" "But Mr. Copy," said Mary, "appears to have none of that warmth of imagination,
which you are describing." "Your observation is very just," said Montgomery, laughing;
"and I have wondered how it was possible for him to be a painter, till I recollected that he
was only a Copyist. He has no mind, no fire; he merely paints from what he sees, the only
sense, by which ideas of his art can be brought to his comprehension; and I have seen an
automaton painter in a piece of mechanism which would exactly give you my idea of
Copy. "How much preferable is a little general knowledge to such an unlimited
predilection for one pursuit, unless that pursuit forms the means of existence? But I am
now speaking of it merely as forming agreeable companions; and I think I could have
picked out persons, who, though not so clever, as it is called, would have been much
more amusing and instructive to Miss Moreton, than the group at present assembled at the
Villa." "I dare answer for it you could," said Mary, "and I greatly fear, that neither the
taste or the benevolence of Miss Moreton are quite correct. I have no right to speak of her
conduct; and, most probably, I might be equally unthinking and credulous, if placed in a
similar situation; but with respect to amusement, I think I should never select the
gentlemen we have been talking of to contribute towards it, any more than I should the
Chevalier D'Aubert for an object of charity." Mary spoke the last words with more emphasis than was common to her, for the
story she had been hearing at the cottage was yet fresh on her mind. "Nor to me, either, does the Chevalier D'Aubert appear an object of compassion,"
said Montgomery. "That noble patriotism which led the nobility of France to prefer
emigration to becoming the subjects of an usurper; that constant attachment to a
dethroned and murdered sovereign, which led them to relinquish their fortunes and to
confiscate their estates, to prove their fealty and allegiance; which taught them to brave
the horrors of want and penury in a foreign land; was worthy of the highest applause, and
the benevolent exertions of all good men. But, when we see these misfortunes made the
pretext for introducing into this country all the frivolity, the false philosophy, and the
licentiousness of France; when we see the promulgation of such sentiments received and
cherished here, merely because they call themselves emigrants; we must naturally feel the
most irrepressible disgust; and I think, in my whole life, I never met with a being towards
whom I felt it in so great a degree, as the Chevalier D'Aubert!" "He strikes me as a most artful and dangerous character," said Mary. "He certainly
is so:" returned Montgomery. "The frivolous coxcombry of the fiddling Monsieur is seen
and laughed at; but the sighing sophistry of D'Aubert has more serious effects; for, under
the mask of pensive sentimentality, he would sap every principle which can make us
happy here, and take from us every bright prospect of an hereafter! "-Montgomery
paused; he seemed startled at his own seriousness; for, turning towards Mary, he said, "I
might apologise to you for talking in this sententious strain; but indeed, Miss Cuthbert, I
feel greatly interested for you-I seem to have acquired a right to converse with you in
the language of friendship and sincerity, from having been privy to the amiable emotion,
excited in your bosom, when my friend Walwyn, so unintentionally, let you a little into
the character of your protectress. Believe me, when I tell you, that it is with no little
anxiety, on the account of her protegï¿½, that I have, since I came to the Villa, employed
myself in scrutinizing the character of Miss Moreton!" "And what has been the result of your investigation?" asked Mary, looking up
with undissembled earnestness into the face of Montgomery. "Ah!" said he, shaking his
head, with a desponding expression, "where there is so much confidence, so little
judgment, and such a boundless thirst of praise, what can be expected but selfish and
capricious conduct? Miss Moreton just now believes, that she may do any thing; that she
is the object of universal attention and admiration; and that notoriety and applause will
incessantly follow her steps. Poor young lady! she is to be pitied for entertaining such
fallacious and extravagant notions; but she has too much self-conceit to be undeceived. I
have been studying your character a little, likewise," said he, his voice lowering, and
seeming almost afraid to trust himself to look at Mary. Neither did Mary examine his
countenance with the lively earnestness that she had before displayed; the crimson
suffused her cheek, as she said, "Indeed! my character! pray give it to me, Mr. Montgomery?" "I have been examining it, as it relates to Miss Moreton," said he; "and I confess
that the timidity, which prevents Miss Cuthbert from unfolding the graces of her mind
and the charms of her conversation, in indiscriminate society, and which has been a
severe mortification to me, since I have resided under the same roof with her, is yet the
best promise that I perceive of her continuing on tolerable terms with her guardian; and
will, at the same time, shield her from the bold and unlicensed attacks of her associates!" "Oh! may I ever feel constrained and awed in their society, if it will be a prevention from

danger," cried Mary, clasping her hands together-"Yet may I always fearlessly speak at
the command of Virtue!" "That, I am confident, you ever will," said Montgomery, taking her clasped hands
tenderly, yet respectfully, in his-"charming Miss Cuthbert, you are most peculiarly
situated; Providence has thought fit to place you, where your patience and your
forbearance must be exerted; but, while you follow the pious rectitude of your own heart,
you will have nothing to fear! you will go through the path of duty with cheerful
magnanimity!" "You are very good to embolden me," said Mary, releasing her hand to wipe off
the starting tear. At that moment Walwyn appeared coming towards them, and, gaily
kissing his hand to Mary, he said, "Miss Moreton in the Lyceum waits,
"The banquet spread, and all her guests
assembl'd,
"For thee, sweet maid, and for thy charm'd
companion,
"She now the tardy moments chide,
"That keep thee from the light repast. "Haste then, fair Mary, haste,
"And tea and butter'd muffins taste. "With sugar sweet as thy own lip,
"The balmy sweets of India sip!" Sorry to be late at the breakfast-table, Mary hastened into the Lyceum, followed
by the two gentlemen; she flung off her hat, as she passed through the Corridor; her fine
brown tresses parted on her white forehead, and her cheeks glowed with the freshness of
the morning, and she afforded a pretty striking contrast to some of the assembled group. "They represent vices as frailties, and frailties as
virtues." FORDYCE. THE veil of Miss Moreton half shaded her face, as she reclined on a sopha, at the head of
the long table, on which the breakfast was spread; bouquets of flowers were placed at
every plate. Germ and Copy were already seated; the latter was holding a moss rose at a
short distance from him, and whistling at it, as if in the act of pourtraying it on paper;
while Germ, with green spectacles, was examining a leaf on which he had found the
aurelia of a butterfly. Miss Moreton was studying, and did not, (or pretended not to) hear
the entrance of Mary Cuthbert, or her morning compliments. Walwyn took his seat at her
right hand, and, understanding its motion, immediately began to pour out the tea; when
the Chevalier glided into the room, pressed the disengaged hand of Miss Moreton to his
forehead, and to his heart, and, partly enveloping himself beneath her veil, leant over her
shoulder to become a participator in her studies. Montgomery and Mary seated
themselves; and Monsieur Myrtilla, skipping in, in the dress in which Mary had seen him
the preceding morning, said, "One, too, tree million pardons vor de chere Belle Signora;
she has not leave her toilette yet, so I just promise to make'a coffee vor two in her apartment. Bon jour, Mademoiselle Moreton;" and away he ran. "Do you know this flower," asked Germ, addressing Walwyn. "Can you tell me
what an egg is?" said Walwyn, smiling, as he took one. "Certainly, certainly," answered
Germ; "let me see this little book-No, hang it, this is my Essay on Crocodiles. I have,
though, somewhere certainly"-searching his left hand pocket. "No-wrong again, that is
the History of the Horned Owl. Ah! here, here it comes at last; let me see-Eggs! page
one hundred and sixty-three. Now, Sir, we have it." "I have had it, Sir," said Walwyn,
crashing the empty shell in the ear of the philosopher. "Pish, pish!" cried Germ, starting and settling his spectacles. "The egg you have
had, but not its history; Willoughby, in his Ornithology, says, page one hundred and sixtythree-
Willoughby says 'we may easily distinguish the yolk in the heart of an egg, as
likewise the first white substance that surrounds it, and a second white in which the mass
in the middle swims.'"
