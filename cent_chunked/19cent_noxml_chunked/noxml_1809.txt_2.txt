her aunt might be said to be the only one who had ever spoken it to

her; and, coming under so homely and ungraceful a garb, no wonder that she turned from
it with disgust and disdain to the more fascinating tones of falshood! "Stern rugged nurse! thy rigid lore
"With patience many (an hour) she bore!" GRAY. AFTER a restless and uncomfortable night, Mary Cuthbert left her pillow; and having
taken a survey of the park, and the surrounding country, from her windows, and made a
little arrangement of her wardrobe, she stole down stairs, intending to taste the morning
air by a short stroll. All was quiet in the house, and she found her way to the corridor, and
the door of the Lyceum being open, she saw a house-maid busily engaged with her duster
and brushes. "Are none of the family stirring?" asked Mary. "Oh dear, no, Miss," said the
servant with a curtesy. "Does Miss Moreton breakfast in this room?" "Oh no, Miss, she
do breakfast, most common, in the Boy doer, with the French Caviller; only sometimes
she gets up earlyish, when the Captain be here, because they spouts a bit together, before
breakfast, with the pebble stones in their mouths, out there in the park, because they do
make plays in there, in the theatre, together." "Has Miss Moreton a private theatre in the
Villa?" "Yes, that's what she have, Miss-t'was a chapel in old times, but now 'tis
convarted, you see!" Mary Cuthbert shuddered at the perversion of her cousin; when a tall
figure, in a blue worsted dressing-gown and scarlet night-cap, crossed the gravel-walk,
outside the windows; she started. The maid, who was a simple uninformed creature, burst
into a loud and hearty laugh; "I'fegs, Miss, I don't wonder at your being a little gushed;
what a quare figure he do cut, to be sure! he is really terrifying to behold!" "Is the poor
creature beside himself?" "Oh law's me, no, Miss, he be only one of the Floss-all-overs,
as they call 'em; 'tis Mr. Germ; he as you seed last night; he gets up early to snailing!" "What is that?" asked Mary. "What, don'tee know, Miss? Why, he've been a gathering of
snails, and slugs, and caterpillars. Oh law! he's a most enauseous old gentleman, to be
sure; and you little know the work I've a got to clean after he; he brings it all into the
house; as Joseph said, t'other night, he makes his room like Noah's ark, for he hath got
creeping things numerable as the sand upon the sea shore, sexing and dissexing of it; look
at 'en now, Miss, he is gallopping away, long-legs, spectacles and all, after a drumble
drone! What an old fool 'tis!" Mary perceiving the servant to be very much inclined to
volubility, now took up a book, and returned to her own apartment, not wishing to
encounter Mr. Germ, by going out in the park, for she perceived that his race was not yet
run. The book that she had taken was an English translation of a German play; it did not
suit her taste; the language was bombastic; the sentiments were too lively drawn to do
more than meet the ear; there was no depth of thought, no soundness of principle, and no
invention in the fable; the catastrophe was unnatural and horrible. She had just concluded
it, when the following note was put into her hand:-
"My dear Coz!-As I heard you say, last night, that you did not understand the
French language, I will not inflict on you the misery of being present at my d�jeune,
which I shall have in my Boudoir this morning, as the dear Chevalier is good enough to
read to me a most inimitable novel, the work of one of his own country-women. Such a
novel! oh! my dear Mary, could you but read Delphine, or rather could you but hear it

read by the Chevalier, with my feelings, you would receive a gratification almost celestial. I shall not be able to see you till near dinner time, having appointed a little rehearsal with
Walwyn, when D'Aubert shall have left me. I have ordered breakfast for you alone, as the
Signora and the Monsieur have usually a morning's t�te-a-t�te, � la Fran�oise, in her
room, and Mr. Germ's speculative and free inquiries into the wonders of Nature do not in
general render him a very desirable companion for the repast of the morning; and I fear
poor Copy might whistle you out of countenance. The two friends will probably lounge
over their coffee together, while Walwyn gets himself perfect in his part, previous to
meeting with me. This is Liberty-Hall, so pray amuse yourself as you like whilst under
the roof of
"CLARISSA MORETON." Mary Cuthbert smiled at the various ways in which Miss Moreton's visitors were
disposed and dispersed, though her heart sickened at the romantic and extraordinary stile
of the billet, and the unblushing ease with which Clarissa admitted men to a t�te-a-t�te in
her private apartment. Breakfast was prepared for Mary in a snug little parlour; which was
more in unison with her habits and occupations, than Lyceums or Boudoirs. Supposing
herself free from interruption for some hours, she employed herself in altering some white
dresses, previous to throwing off her deep sables; and she had been reverting to the times
when she had worn them last; when she had been the happiest of the happy; blessed with
the fostering protection of both her parents, and sheltered in the parsonage of Woodberry;
tears of irrepressible sorrow forced their way at the recollection. Her back was towards
the door, when she heard it open, and a loud and discordant voice said, "For once, then, I
see my niece employed as I could wish. So, you have at last learnt how to handle your
needle; Miss Moreton, I sincerely congratulate you." Mary Cuthbert rose from her seat,
and turned her tearful eyes on an old lady of stern and harsh physiognomy, who stood in
an erect posture of surprise, as she earnestly surveyed her. That this old lady was Mrs.
Deborah Moreton, the aunt of her protectress, Mary instantly perceived, and hastily
wiping her eyes, and placing her a chair, with a graceful, yet modest curtsey, she desired
her to be seated, and that she would ring, and order the servant to acquaint Miss Moreton
of her arrival. "No, child! no!" cried the old lady, detaining her by stretching out her long
cane, and laying the end of it on her arm. "No, pray sit down, and go on with your work. My niece, Miss Clarissa Moreton, minds me just as much as she does you. Your name is
Cuthbert, I suppose?" "Yes, Ma'am." "You are very much like your aunt Moreton, child;
if you wore your hair combed straight over a toupee, and had a fine taper waist, I should
almost conceit that I saw her again, when my brother first brought her into Coventry. When did you come, child?" "Last evening, Madam." "And is it true that the ranting,
raving Captain is here again, and some other young scape-grace?" "Captain Walwyn is
here, Ma'am, with a Mr. Montgomery." "Oh fie, fie!" said the lady, holding up her stick,
and lifting up her eyes; "here are doings with a witness! Book-worms, painters, fiddlers,
and Frenchmen, an't enough, it seems, but the rake-hellish red coats must come forth. Oh,
if your aunt was alive, she would mourn these days, these dissolute days, in sackcloth and
ashes; but she, poor woman, was taken from the evil to come! Miss Cuthbert, you seem to
be like your aunt in character, as well as in person. She was a regular, a modest, and a
well-behaved woman!" "You are very good, Madam, to entertain so favourable an

opinion of me. I hope I shall conduct myself so as to deserve it." "Why, in truth, child, I
am not apt to pay compliments; Honest Blunt is the name I go by, and if I would retain
my character, I can speak no smooth words in times like these. The whole world is turned
upside down, now-a-days. I am confident that it will very soon be at an end; for
wickedness is come to its highest pitch! In my days, if a young woman was seen to be
speaking to a man, unless he happened to be her father, her brother, or at least her cousingerman,
he was set down as her betrothed admirer, and it generally turned out that he
became her husband; but now 'tis hoity-toity, higgledy-piggledy, fiddling, racketting,
acting, a parcel of fellows kept and maintained in the house of a young woman, for no
earthly purpose, that I see, but to make her the talk and the scandal of the whole
neighbourhood. Here is the mischief and folly of leaving young girls to their own
guidance. Talk of fortune and independence, forsooth; in God's name, let her enjoy her
fortune and her riches; who is to prevent her? who wishes to prevent her? I ask; but then,
let her enjoy it like a reasonable being, and like a Christian, and use it with moderation;
let her visit the poor; let her work for them; let her make baby-linen for the honest wives;
let her have a good piece of roast beef, and a handsome pudding of a Sunday; let her give
amply at the altar, and never turn away her face from a poor man in distress; and in God's
name let her chuse some respectable man of character, and a steady age, and after a
reasonable time, a year or two spent in the proper formalities of courtship, let her marry,
and so secure to herself a protector. I have no objection to these things; I do not wish her,
I do not want her, to live single, nor to hoard up her money: but to spend it on lazy rattletrap
vermin, who do not care one farthing for her, it makes me almost frantic!" "Miss
Moreton seems very good humoured and amiable, Madam," said Mary, now interposing a
word, as Mrs. Deborah Moreton literally stopped to draw breath. "I think that she would
attend to any advice which came from so near a relative, and which was so well
intentioned." "You would not think her so, if you knew her," said Mrs. Deborah; "she
always acts in direct opposition to me, as if she studied the rule of contrary, for no other
end, but to teaze and provoke me; but no matter, I do my duty, I always have spoke my
mind, and I always will, let what will come of it. She is my own niece, and if I don't
speak out, who else will? I don't mince matters-no, not I. The blacker she looks, the
more I talk; and if I think my company is not wanted, I will come the oftener, to see how
things are going on. It shall never be said that her own aunt deserted her, though I may
have hurted my own character, for aught I know, by continuing to come here; for, except
myself, I believe she cannot reckon a truly chaste and virtuous woman in the whole range
of her acquaintance. And indeed, Miss Cuthbert, I am glad to see that she had the grace to
accept the guardianship of your person, though I believe your father would as soon have
thought of sending you to Jericho as here, had he known what a sort of a daughter his
poor sister had left behind her!" Mary thought so too: her heart sickened at the description
of Mrs. Deborah Moreton; for, however exaggerated, that she was placed in a most
awkward and extraordinary situation was very apparent. "Who have you seen this
morning, child?" "Nobody, but the servant who has attended me, Ma'am, or those who I
have met in the apartments as I passed." "And that is as it should be, let me give you a
word of advice, the less you are with the pack who are assembled here the better-much
the better will it be for you." "Indeed, Madam," said Mary, "I am so wholly unacquainted
with the world, that I feel very awkward in such a mixed party." "I know a good deal of

the world," said Mrs. Deborah, raising her head and her cane at the same time. "But, as
you rightly say, this is a mixture, and that too of its very scum and dregs-of all countries
too; and now in the time of war, when a true-bred Englishwoman should avoid a
Frenchman, with as much care as she would a serpent! For is not one the natural enemy
of her country, as the other was in old times of her sex? Now are these doors opened to as
many of 'em as will come, and the more they jabber and chatter their monkey nonsense,
and kick their maccaroni heels, the more are they applauded and caressed!" At that
moment entered Monsieur Myrtilla, in a chintz robe de chambre, lined with pink sarsnet,
red and sharp pointed slippers, with high green heels, and about fifty strings of light blue
ribbon at the knees of his flesh-coloured muslin small clothes, while his hair was rolled
up in as many papillots; his violin was slung round his shoulder, and tyed by a bunch of
the same blue ribbon on the top of his shoulder. "Ah! me demand pardons, Ma'amselle,
me thought you were all alone, so brought my fiddle, thinking to entertain a Ma'amselle,
with one, two, pretty petit ariettes." "I believe, Sir, neither Miss Cuthbert or myself could
derive entertainment from your airs," said Mrs. Deborah Moreton, "although it must be
confessed that they are very extraordinary." "Madam, you do me much, ver great
honneur, by de compliment," said Monsieur, making several bows, and skipping off with
the most assured and unembarrassed countenance. "You may say what you will to this
herd of parasites and sycophants," said Mrs. Deborah, "they will not be offended, they
pretend to take it all in the way coom-plee-maung, as the French monkey calls it; and as a
dog returns to the vomit, so do they resume their grimaces and contortions; my niece must
see the contemptible insignificancy of this animal, but she countenances him merely
because he can play the fiddle, as if the scraping a stick to and fro on a few strings to
tickle the ear could make up for the want of every thing besides." How long Mrs.
Deborah Moreton might have pursued her harangue, is uncertain; but the first dinner bell
sounding, she said to Mary, "I suppose, child, you will want to make some little alteration
in your dress, though you are mighty well, for aught I see, clean and decent, which is
more than you will be able to say of all your companions; however, don't mind me, I shall
look about me; but I mean to stay to dinner, I generally do so about once or twice a week;
to put some little restraint on the company, by the presence of one of my respectability. I
make it a point of conscience, for I assure you, I feel no pleasure from the visit." Mary
Cuthbert folded up her work preparatory to leaving the room. "Aye, aye, your guardian
may learn a little tidiness and order of you, I see, if she would. Ah, child, you have been
well brought up! I see you have been well brought up; I dare say your mother was a clever
notable woman!" Mary's heart was full; she longed to speak in praise of her mother, but
her tongue refused its office. So, making a silent curtesy, she withdrew. "Vain is the tree of knowledge without fruits."
