Martha shook her head. "You will not see him, I believe, of one while. What misfortune has happened to my friend? Is he not in Paris? That he is! Why is he not with me? Why am I separated from the only man that for a long time, I have dared to trust? I insist upon his being sent for immediately. Go,
Martha, and tell mr. Scarborough I am dying to see him. Mr. Gifford is in prison; the Bastille, or the Con---concier ---,I do not know what name they call it. In prison? my friend in prison? I will rise this moment, and procure his freedom! What is he in prison for? Why, sir, it is a queer kind of a story. I do not exactly understand it. It is something about your valet, that ran away from you yesterday. They are both in
prison. Captain---Lord bless me, I had like to have let it all out!--- the gentleman, you know, sir, that delivered

you from the robbers yesterday,---
That gentleman was not mr. Scarborough? No, sir, no, but I am bid not tell his name. Well, sir, he went to a place they call the Police. Those people of the Police are as quick as lightning. The
first inkling we had of the matter was from the valet's running away. Captain---the gentleman, I mean--- told them no more than that; and what did they do,
but
caught Gifford last night, and this morning early they sent word they had caught the valet too. Saying this, she left me; and in about an hour returned.---Well, sir, said she, it is all out. Gifford is the great rascal of the whole gang, and he will be
hanged. Martha, be silent. I always had a respect for your qualities, and I cannot

bear to hear from your mouth, whatever I might from others, these scurrilities against the only honourable man I have lately found in the world.---Where is mr.
Gifford? what has happened to him? We all saw from the first, sir, that it could be no common robbery. Why did your valet take to his heels, and leave you? Martha, I am thoroughly convinced in that point. He was an accomplice with the villains who attacked me. Ah, sir, but that is not all. If he had been only their accomplice, he would have been only a robber. What have you lost? You must have been some time in the
hands of the rogues, and yet your watch, your purse, your rings, your pocket-book, every thing is safe. They meant to murder you, sir,---to murder you, not
for
what you had about you, but for your estate! Martha, leave me! I shall for ever abhor the sight of you, if you talk thus. It has been my fault to be too mistrustful,---
That it has, sir! I cling to mr. Gifford as my last hold upon human nature. If I could think him base, I would fly the face of man, and herd with wolves and tigers. Thank God,
there is no danger of that! He has done me such services, as scarcely ever one man did for another. He unmasked all my treacherous friends.---
He put on a mask yesterday. When their perfidy had reduced me to the brink of the grave, when it had unseated my reason, and made me a maniac, he only comforted me; he watched by me day
and night; his services and attention were inexhaustible; he has saved my life over and over. He conspire my death!---Pooh, pooh, Martha, if you would
deceive
me, let it be

with things possible, and not with such absurd romances as children would laugh at. What signifies talking, sir?---They have given the valet the boots, they call it---a contrivance the French have to squeeze the truth out of a man---and he has
confessed that Gifford was at the bottom of all. I am more grieved than I can express, at what you tell me, Martha. But that accounts for all. Diabolical contrivance! ---Oh, England! beloved country, that
gave me birth! nurse of liberty, virtue, and good sense! never shall thy gallant name be deformed with this sabbath of demons!---Now, Martha, learn from me,

and blush for what you have said! Can you, a Briton, believe, that torture makes a man speak the truth? that, when he writhes with agony, and feels himself
debased below a brute, his words are to be regarded as oracles? Would not a man then say any thing, to put an end to what he suffers? I would not hang a dog on such evidence! What sort of creature should I be, if I could
give up my friend, my tried friend, a man unequalled in fidelity of spirit and honourable sentiment, for the random accusations of a thief on the rack? There may be something in that, sir. But we know mr. Gifford before. The valet can tell nothing of him too bad for what he has done already.---However they
will give him the boots, and we shall then hear what he will say! God of Heaven!---Gifford!---;God, that we were escaped from this den of barbarians!---Call mr. Scarborough! Say, I must speak to him immediately! I will, sir. All, I see plain, will soon come out. I understand you, Martha. You have been cheated with the story of those

domestic pests of mine, whom Gifford's generous exertions have succeeded to rid me of for ever. Every unhappy transgressor against virtue and integrity has a
plausible story of his own to tell, and does not fail to boil with indignation against some one of those by whom he is detected and punished. I did intend to

give a fresh hearing to the cause of my unhappy, pernicious wife,---
God bless you! I am very glad of that! But I have no leisure for this now. Gifford is to me father, brother, wife and children, all in one! Mr. Scarborough came in. I had seen him casually in Berkshire, but I had never carefully observed his figure till now. There was something almost awful in it,
and that even to me who could have no extrinsic occasion to stand in awe of my country-neighbour. He was tall,

and of a carriage bold and graceful. His hairs were of a pure brown, uncontaminated with art. There was good sense and penetration, mixed with an uncommon air
of severity, in his countenance. He seemed born to command. When he spoke, there was no spark of self-diffidence or embarrassment. He appeared always to see

the right method of proceeding, to confide in his own judgment, and to be firm. Had I beheld such a figure placed on a bench of justice, I should have said,

There sits one of the judges of the patriarchal world, invested with native rank and conscious discernment, not one of the modern race, who place their hopes

to awe us in accoutrements of velvet and ermine! Mr. Scarborough, said I, I know not exactly how I came here, but I have first to thank you for your hospitality. He bowed. Having acknowledged this favour, I have another still greater to demand. My friend and kinsman, mr. Gifford, is in prison. Martha, your servant, tells me he is
in a very distressing situation. I am not in a fit condition to go and solicit his liberation myself,---
Mr. Gifford is a villain! For God's sake, mr. Scarborough!--- This is no time to discuss his merits.--- You are, I am sure, too generous and too just to defame the absent. I wish mr. Gifford had been so. My friend, lieutenant Kenrick,---
Kenrick! Is he in Paris? He is under this roof. Oh! then I see how it is! You are deceived, mr. Scarborough. You are the dupe of unfortunate criminals, that hope, by means of your character and authority, to
destroy the honest man whose integrity they fear. You are deceived, mr. Fleetwood. You are the dupe of a criminal, a wretch whom I will not condescend to grace with the term unfortunate.--- I am not used to be
deluded, sir, nor does this case admit of ambiguity.---Mr. Kenrick, the best man on earth, and who loves you the most devotedly,---(It was he who rescued you

last night from the assassins who were on the point to murder you,---
Kenrick! ---Went instantly, when he had conducted you hither, to the police. He had no information to give, but that of the disappearance of your valet, and that he saw
a figure among the ruffians greatly resembling that of Gifford. Accursed calumniator! On these grounds monsieur the lieutenant criminel proceeded. He caused both the persons informed against to be apprehended. Though the valet had

taken refuge in a remote part of the city, he easily succeeded to discover his retreat. Gifford appeared boldly at his own lodgings. When told however that the
valet was in custody, he dropt something of his assurance. The wretched hireling, being put to the torture, laid open a long train of villainy, and pointed
out
his accomplices; they are all now in custody. Mr. Scarborough, I will not stay a moment longer in this house. Procure me a litter, a fiacre , any thing! I fly to the vindication of my friend. Of the man who way-laid you yesterday? Who with his own hand presented a pistol to your head? It is waste of words for us to talk longer. You lend your ear to the wretched, the unnatural Kenrick, the Cain who is at this moment pursuing the destruction
of his virtuous brother. Do you, as you please! I, for my part, listened to and believed him too long. If you wish to see the lieutenant criminel , he will in two hours transport himself hither to complete his examinations. I cannot consent to your removal,
which in your present situation might be fatal. If you wish to serve Gifford, you cannot do it more speedily, than by waiting the arrival of the
magistrate.---
In the mean time suffer me to instruct you in some particulars. It will bring the matter to a more ready conclusion. I wish to satisfy you of the innocence
of
Kenrick and your wife. Mr. Scarborough, it is absurd for us to talk on that head. I did not proceed but upon the most demonstrative evidence. The case has been tried by the criminal
courts of my country; the wariness of justice has been satisfied; Kenrick has been declared guilty, my

wife an adultress, and her child illegitimate. Why should you open afresh wounds in my soul, to which the blow I received yesterday is the stroke of a feather,
and which will assuredly bring me to the grave? Mr. Fleetwood, ask yourself! Would it afford you no pleasure to find, that your wife is the most innocent of mortals, that Kenrick's heart is as honest and
generous as his countenance, and that the lovely boy which mrs. Fleetwood has brought into the world, is your true and proper offspring? No pleasure! It would make me young again! It would translate me to Elysium! I should feel as the founder of the human race felt, before guilt and treachery
got footing in the world! And is not the chance of this worth one hour's enquiry? The very thought transports me! Go on! Be patient then, and strict, and impartially severe! What evidence had you of mrs. Fleetwood's guilt? A love-letter of Kenrick, which I took on her dressing-table. That letter was not written to her. For whom was it intended? For my daughter.---What else? The miniature of Kenrick, which I found locked up in her casket. That too was for my daughter.---Proceed! An interview which I witnessed between her and her paramour in the elmwalk, on the right bank of the Kennet. My perfidious kinsman came from Beverley to
Berkshire for the express purpose of this interview. That also had relation to my daughter. My wife, when challenged by me respecting this interview, prevaricated, pretended to know nothing of the matter,

and asked whether Kenrick was not at his quarters in Yorkshire? That I can explain. These were the circumstances on which I acted personally. But the whole has since been cleared up by the laws of my country. Witnesses have proved the criminal
conversation in Merionethshire, as well as Mary's confession that the child was the child of Kenrick. These witnesses were suborned. They are now under prosecution for perjury. Why did my wife refuse to justify herself, when for the last time before I left England, I reproached her with her guilt, and called upon her to answer? Fleetwood, you then said to her,--- you adjured her by the great God, who made heaven and earth, to tell you, Whose child was that she bore in her
womb?---Could a woman, shocked with such a question, a woman who knew the integrity of all her actions, the purity of

all her thoughts, the devotion with which she had ever watched and served her lord, answer the deluded insolent that proposed such an interrogatory? Then may
virtue stoop to vice, then may heaven and hell mix in eternal confusion, and honour and nobleness of soul no longer have a name in the universe! As you put it, it was an insufferable question, and such as conscious rectitude might well disdain to answer. Yet surely, after the first shock had subsided,
the interests of herself and her unborn child, the happiness and reputation of all the parties, which were so intimately concerned, might have induced the
most
innocent and proudest woman on earth to descend to explanation! It was exactly thus that mrs. Fleetwood conducted herself. She transmitted you three days after, when, to my knowledge, you were still at Brighthelmstone, a
detailed explanation of the

whole affair. Why did you take no notice of that letter? I received no such letter. Received---? I am not surprised. The master-villain, whose task it has been to paint every thing in false colours, and to obstruct all the glimpses of truth
and virtue, has then intercepted it. Other letters were written by your kinsman, and by me, did you receive none of these? None. You express your surprise, mr. Scarborough, at my not answering letters. I was not less surprised at Mary's returning no answer to the letter, in which I
informed her that, notwithstanding all I had suffered from her perfidy, I had spontaneously settled upon her an annuity of one thousand pounds. Guilt itself,
I
thought, would have expressed some gratitude for my generosity. Innocence, ---it was impossible that innocence

should at such a moment have sat down in silence! Seeing the case as you saw it, this was a generous determination, mr. Fleetwood, and proves to me that you are the good and honourable man I ever believed you
to be.---No such letter as you describe, no letter of any kind, was ever received from you by mrs. Fleetwood. I see plainly that, from the moment you left
Berkshire, you have been a close prisoner in the keeping of the villain, who was proceeding with rapid, yet deliberate steps, to thrust you out from the
scene
of the world, and to reap the inheritance of your estates. But it is time, my dear sir, that you should be somewhat acquainted with the affairs of myself and

my daughter, which have so intimate a relation to mrs. Fleetwood's unfortunate story. Proceed, sir! You have created in me

a desire, at least to hear what can be suggested, in behalf of my wife, and of the man you call your friend. You have made bold assertions; I do not see how
they can be supported. If they can, I have been the most unfortunate,---the most unjust of mankind. I have been many years a widower, resumed mr. Scarborough. When my wife died, she left to me the care of two infants, a son and a daughter. The birth of my
daughter, my Louisa, who is now with me, preceded by only two years the death of her mother. The charge which thus devolved upon me, weighed heavy upon my
mind, and it is with unintermitted anxiety that I have sought to perform it. I brought into the world with me the seeds of a stern and severe disposition; this has been the source of all my misfortunes. My temper is firm; my judgment
perhaps is clear; and I have ever been somewhat too peremptory in inforcing it. My ordinary speech---whatever (added

he, smiling) you may have found it on the present occasion---is pithy and sententious. I have been prone to lay down the law, and too impatient of the
perverseness, real or imaginary, that demurred to my dictates. I have always seen these faults of my character, though never so clearly as now, and have
endeavoured to correct them. But either they were so twisted with my nature, that they could not be separated and discarded, or I have found myself weak, and

insufficient to the office. I wished to inspire attachment and confidence into my wife; but I could never succeed. She was a gentle and amiable creature, beautiful as the day, and of
manners inexpressibly enchanting. She confessed, that she feared, as much as she loved me; I thought that the former was the predominant passion. The
perception of this, instead of correcting me, rendered me more gloomy,

and increased my original defects. I saw that I was poisoning the existence of her I loved. I believe that, when she came to die, she was the more reconciled
to her fate, because, while living, she was a stranger to the enjoyments of life. Oh, mr. Fleetwood, you called yourself the most unfortunate of mankind! You

have never known, like me, the misery of not being able to excite love in any of the persons most dear to you! Men style me honest, and honourable, and
worthy;
I am alone in the world, surrounded with a magic circle, that no man oversteps, and no man is daring enough to touch me! This is called Respect---its genuine

name is Misery! As mr. Scarborough spoke thus, I saw his lips quivering, and he wiped the moisture from his eyes, and from his brow. After a pause he resumed:
My son was the lovleiest boy that ever was beheld. His temper was gentle, his

heart was affectionate, his understanding was clear, and his views were noble. I was the father of this boy---it was I that killed him! You will not suppose
that I did not love him; I loved him to the utmost excess of paternal attachment. But this very excess rendered me restless, impatient and exacting. I was
never satisfied with any thing short of perfection. I crossed him in all his humours; I never allowed him a moment of freedom. Task still succeeded to task,

and in none of them could he obtain my applause. He was often very earnest in his exertions; but earnestness gradually gave place to despair. With what
severity I have rebuked him; with what contumely and contempt I have treated him! It is one of the infirmities of our nature, that the very sound of the
voice
of him who reproves warms the speaker into higher passion and more terrifying fury. The very

dissatisfaction that we feel with ourselves, the consciousness that all is not right in this mode of proceeding, increases our ill-humour, and impels us to
plunge into greater excess, in the hope that so we may drown our remorse. The spirit of my son was broken. Finding himself habitually treated with contempt,
he
began also to despise himself. He became negligent of his person and his health; and, bereft of hope, he was incapable of exertion. As he grew taller, he
felt
more deeply the misery of his situation, and at the age of thirteen literally fell a victim to my ill-placed severity. He sunk into a deep decline. Too late I became sensible of my injustice. How many bitter tears I have shed over him! They were almost as plentiful, as those
which my cruelty so often caused to trickle down his innocent, beautiful cheeks. He told me that he pardoned me with all his heart, that he was

conscious that all I did had been designed for his advantage. I sought to recover him to cheerfulness and health; I promised that I would never again utter a
harsh word, or entertain a harsh thought toward him. It was too late. With his dying lips he kissed the lips that had so often reviled, and the hand that had

smitten him. You would think, mr. Fleetwood, that two such terrible events as the deaths of my wife and son, would have been sufficient to correct in me this odious
propensity. It did for a while. I made a thousand good resolutions. It was impossible to feel with more horror than I did, that I was the murderer of my only

son, and deserved the gallows more than all the highwaymen and housebreakers that are brought thither. But the habit was rooted within me, and, though
repeatedly pared away to the quick, it shot up again with as vigorous and rank a vegetation

as ever. You only, by the entanglement of your affairs with mine, have led me to reflect decisively on the enormity of my crime, and inspired me with the
resolution to banish it for ever. You have seen my daughter. I need not tell you that she is beautiful, or that she is the most gay and animated creature in the world. These last advantages she
has owed to my happy providence, in taking care that she should be seldom, and only for short intervals, at home. If she had resided with me, I should have
rendered her as gloomy as myself; I should have sown in her infant constitution the seeds of destruction. But I determined, that a man, living alone, was by
no
means the proper person to form the mind and manners of a daughter. I resigned the care of her to her mother's relations. They were of the same soft and
gentle
mould with my deceased wife. If I may presume to judge, in a point where I

have myself so greatly erred, they rather exceeded on the side of indulgence. She was at Bath with one of her aunts, when she first formed an acquaintance with mrs. Fleetwood and lieutenant Kenrick. With the former she exchanged the vows
of an eternal friendship. She was delighted with both; and it was perhaps the circumstance of seeing her chosen female friend and the amiable young soldier
continually together, that made her with girlish heedlessness conceive a passion for the latter. The sentiment was mutual; and Kenrick, infinitely superior
to
all interested views, became enamoured unawares of the opulent heiress. From the moment they were lovers, they grew sensible of the necessity of secrecy. I
cultivated with great assiduity ambitious projects for my daughter, and resolved not to marry her below the peerage. I also prescribed

it as an indispensible condition, that her husband should lay aside the name of his own family, and assume that of mine. With both these resolutions Louisa was
acquainted; but, alas! she did not love me. She lived much with her mother's relations, and little with me; the austerity of my manners, though I endeavoured

to tame and assuage it, repelled her, and she was influenced by what had been told her of the unhappy fate of her mother and brother. She felt therefore in a

very small degree the inclination to oblige me; and perhaps you will think they were no trivial compliances that I required of her. This situation was the first cause of the equivocal appearances you observed at Bath. Kenrick and Louisa contrived to be as much together as possible; but my
daughter prescribed it as an indispensible condition to this, that they

should avoid all public manifestations of the understanding which subsisted between them. Mrs. Fleetwood was attached to both; the kindness of her nature
rendered the idea of thwarting their desires alien to her thoughts; she lent herself willingly to the prosecution of their plans. It was concerted that,
whenever they walked together, Kenrick should give his hand to your wife, while my daughter should accept the civilities of any chance-comer. They seldom or

ever sat together; they scarcely spoke. Mrs. Fleetwood was the interpreter of their mutual passion. She received and conveyed from one to the other the
protestations of eternal love; she stood the proxy of each, listening to the effusions of sincere affection, till a by-stander might have imagined, that
Louisa
mistook her for a lover, and that Kenrick was employing every detestable art to seduce her from

her wedded faith. This situation undoubtedly led to extreme familiarity between mrs. Fleetwood and your kinsman; but, if Kenrick had not been secured against a
guilty flame by his admirable principl�s and the integrity of his nature, he would at this time have been triply armed by his passion for my daughter, which,

the more it was restrained, the more it grew. Louisa, perpetually terrified with visions of a haughty and inexorable father, was unintermitted in her
injunctions of secrecy, and above all insisted that you should on no condition be admitted to a knowledge of the affair. At length I completed the preliminaries of the business I had most at heart, the splendid marriage of my daughter. I negociated a union for her with the eldest
son of lord Lindsey, whose estate was in a ruinous situation, and who therefore willingly agreed to all my conditions. The affair was already in great forwardness, when I summoned my daughter from Bath, without informing her of the purpose I had in view. She came to me with a
presentiment of evil, and certainly not with a mind prepared for compliance. I presented the young gentleman. I will now confess, that his most striking
characteristies are ugliness, imbecility and effeminacy. But, infatuated with the grandeur of his alliance, I did not at that time notice these
disadvantages. The proposition of marriage had been agitated between me and lord Lindsey, before I saw the young gentleman; and, when he was introduced, I turned my
attention
to the father, who was handsome, sagacious and accomplished, and, in the pleasure of his conversation, found reason to approve my choice. Louisa, if she had not been already prepossessed in favour of another, would

most likely have shrunk from the marmot I presented to her. Her character on this occasion exhibited a singular mixture of naivet� , rashness and fear. I could
discern a wanton air of contempt and ridicule in her glance, whenever she looked at her noble admirer; it sometimes expressed itself in little sarcastic
sallies, and smothered bursts of laughter. When she caught the flash of my eye, her countenance instantly fell. She would often, if I were absent, or if she

thought I did not observe her amuse herself with leading him a fool's dance, and humorously praising his wit his accomplishments, or his beauty, till the
poor
gentleman was completely in a labyrinth, and looked with a whimsical perplexity, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Whenever I remarked these things, I
sternly discountenanced them. I endeavoured to convince her of the advantages of the proposed marriage. I talked much of parental authority and the duty of a child. I even condescended to intreat her to yield to a plan upon which my heart was entirely bent. She
tried at first to rally me out of my purpose. She painted her suitor in ludicrous colours. She repeated his foolish sayings, and mimicked his gestures. But
she
soon found that this was a style in which her father would not endure to be treated. She then in the most pathetic manner besought me, that I would not
sacrifice the whole happiness of her life, and solemnly protested that she should never know a tranquil moment, if united to the son of lord Lindsey. But
neither of these modes of attack succeeded with me. I was unalterably fixed upon my project. Thus situated, my native character came over me. I exclaimed
that
I was the most abused of fathers. I burst into paroxysms of rage. Often in her absence, sometimes in her presence, I cursed

her for her unnatural obstinacy, and swore that I would rather follow her to her grave, than not see her united to the husband I had chosen. The only confident my daughter and Kenrick had in the whole of this business, except mrs. Fleetwood, was Gifford. He was his brother's friend, as your wife was
the friend of Louisa. Various advantages seemed to spring to the enamoured pair from this arrangement. Gifford and mrs. Fleetwood consulted together for
their
benefit; and, though nothing could exceed the zeal of your wife, she was by no means a match for Gifford in policy and expedients. Beside this, I looked upon

the friendship Louisa had formed with a jealous eye; I naturally judged that woman would be apt to be the abettor of woman in rebellion against the stronger

sex. But I had met with, and conceived an immediate kindness for, Gifford. His serious and contemplative nature seemed easily to

assort with the sternness of mine. I had an entire confidence in his prudence. I laid before him all the arrangements I had made for the marriage of my
daughter, and described its various recommendations. As I saw Louisa paid him a particular attention, I requested him to endeavour to subdue her repugnance,

which he readily promised to do. To the young lovers he appeared as anxious for the accomplishment of their views, as in conversation with me he showed himself favourable to mine. At first
indeed, when Kenrick communicated to him at Bath the secret of his passion, he set himself in opposition to it, and urged to his brother the many misfortunes

and adversities he saw likely to grow upon it. But, as he perceived his remonstrances were fruitless, he changed his tone, yielding rather to the vehemence
of
Kenrick's importunity, than to the propriety of the persuit. He swore he would move heaven

and earth, rather than not conquer every obstacle to his brother's wishes. He encouraged him to go on, and often told him that all difficulties yielded to
perseverance. He however recommended, as earnestly as my daughter had done, that you should be kept in entire ignorance of the affair. He said, that your
prudence would make you insist that Kenrick should renounce the pursuit, and that you would consider yourself as for ever disgraced at your unportioned
kinsman's clandestinely aspiring to the hand of an heiress. He was consulted in every thing. Not a letter was written on either side that did not pass
through
his hands. In short, he appeared so actively engaged in the interests of the lovers, that the further interference of mrs. Fleetwood would have been
unnecessary, were it not that she had been originally in the affair, that her attachment for the parties was vehement, and that Louisa, though she felt
always
respectful and

grateful to mr. Gifford, did not love him. If you found a letter of Kenrick thrown carelessly into one of the toilet-boxes in mrs. Fleetwood's dressing-room, I now entertain no doubt that it was placed
there by Gifford. Mrs. Fleetwood was too careful of the secret of her friend, ever to have been guilty of such negligence. As to the letter itself, the
address
was the address of your wife, which for the sake of precaution it was agreed should always be used; but the person to whose acceptance every line of the
contents referred, was my daughter. Gifford knew of the miniature, which had the same destination, and could have referred you at once to the very spot where

it was found. Thus, mr. Fleetwood, were you, and I, and indeed all the parties in this unhappy business, made the dupes and puppets of a single villain. Louisa, who till now
had seen but little of me, though she had always

heard my name with a certain degree of dread, had by no means at first that terror of my anger and inflexibility which she afterward conceived. She believed
that I could not be inexorable to the tears of my only child; and in this vain hope had indulged with less apprehension the passion of her virgin heart. She

longed to tell me that her affections were engaged, and that, if the son of lord Lindsey had not been in all respects so repulsive as he was, she could never

without a certain kind of prostitution have become his wife. But the more carefully she watched for an opportunity, the more clearly did she perceive that an

opportunity, attended with the smallest degree of auspicious appearance, would never arrive. I in the mean time continued to act the part of a despotic
father,
and pursued my schemes unintermittingly, in the opinion that the caprices of Louisa would at length yield to my enlightened firmness. Driven to extremity,

she came into the plan of an elopement to the North. Gifford was a party to every thing that was settled, but he secretly resolved that the marriage should never take place. It was a part of his project, that
Kenrick should be reduced to beggary. Gifford really stood in awe of his honest and single-hearted brother, and never thought he should be entirely safe,
till
Kenrick was brought to a state of impotence and desolation. The first great mortification he suffered from the hour that he became an inmate of your family,

was on the day that Kenrick set out for Westmorland from Bath.
