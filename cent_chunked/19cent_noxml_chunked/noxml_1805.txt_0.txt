I was the only son of my father. I was very young at the period of the death of my mother, and have retained scarcely any recollection of her. My father was so
much affected by the loss of the amiable and affectionate partner of his days, that he resolved to withdraw for ever from those scenes, where every object he

saw was associated with the ideas of her kindness, her accomplishments, and her virtues: and, being habitually a lover of the sublime and romantic features
of
nature, he fixed upon a spot in Merionethshire,

near the foot of Cader Idris, for the habitation of his declining life. Here I was educated. And the settled melancholy of my father's mind, and the wild and magnificent scenery by which I was surrounded, had an eminent share in
deciding upon the fortunes of my future life. My father loved me extremely; his actions toward me were tender and indulgent; he recognised in me all that
remained of the individual he had loved more than all the other persons in the world. But he was also enamoured of solitude; he spent whole days and nights
in
study and contemplation. Even when he went into company, or received visitors in his own house, he judged too truly of the temper and propensities of boyish

years, to put much restraint upon me, or to require that I should either render myself subservient to the habits of my elders, or, by a ridiculous exhibition

of artificial talents, endeavour

to extract from their politeness nourishment for his paternal vanity or pride. I had few companions. The very situation which gave us a full enjoyment of the beauties of nature, inevitably narrowed both the extent and variety of our
intercourse with our own species. My earliest years were spent among mountains and precipices, amidst the roaring of the ocean and the dashing of waterfalls. A
constant familiarity with these objects gave a wildness to my ideas, and an uncommon seriousness to my temper. My curiosity was ardent, and my disposition
persevering. Often have I climbed the misty mountain's top, to hail the first beams of the orb of day, or to watch his refulgent glories as he sunk beneath
the
western ocean. There was no neighbouring summit that I did not ascend, anxious to see what mountains, vallies, rivers and cities were placed beyond. I

gazed upon the populous haunts of men as objects that pleasingly diversified my landscape; but without the desire to behold them in nearer view. I had a
presentiment that the crowded streets and the noisy mart contained larger materials for constituting my pain than pleasure. The jarring passions of men,
their
loud contentions, their gross pursuits, their crafty delusions, their boisterous mirth, were objects which, even in idea, my mind shrunk from with horror. I

was a spoiled child. I had been little used to contradiction, and felt like a tender flower of the garden, which the blast of the cast wind nips, and
impresses
with the tokens of a sure decay. With such a tone of mind the great features of nature are particularly in accord. In her chosen retreats every thing is busy and alive; nothing is in full
repose. All is diversity and change. The mysterious power of vegetation continually

proceeds; the trees unfold their verdure, and the fields are clothed with grass and flowers. Life is every where around the solitary wanderer; all is health
and bloom; the sap circulates, and the leaves expand. The stalk of the flower, the trunk of the tree, and the limbs of animals dilate, and assume larger
dimensions. The cattle breathe, and the vegetable kingdom consumes the vital air; the herds resort to the flowing stream, and the grass drinks the moisture
of
the earth and the dew of heaven. Even the clouds, the winds and the streams present us with the image of life, and talk to us of that venerable power, which
is
operating every where, and never sleeps. But their speech is dumb; their eloquence is unobtrusive; if they tear us from ourselves, it is with a gentle and a

kindly violence, which, while we submit to, we bless. Here begins the contrast and disparity

between youth and age. My father was a lover of nature; but he was not the companion of my studies in the scenes of nature. He viewed her from his window, or
from the terrace of earth he had raised at the extremity of his garden; he mounted his horse for a tranquil excursion, and kept along the road which was
sedulously formed for the use of travellers. His limbs were stiffened with age; and he was held in awe by the periodical intrusions of an unwelcome visitor,

the gout. My limbs on the contrary were full of the springiness which characterises the morning of life. I bounded along the plains, and climbed the highest

eminences; I descended the most frightful declivities, and often penetrated into recesses which had perhaps never before felt the presence of a human
creature. I rivalled the goat, the native of the mountains, in agility and daring. My only companion was a dog, who by familiarity

had acquired habits similar to mine. In our solitary rambles we seemed to have a certain sympathy with each other; and, when I rested occasionally from the
weariness of my exertions, he came and lay down at my feet, and I often found relief in dalliance with this humble companion amidst the uninhabited wilds
which
received me. Sometimes, when I foresaw an excursion of more than usual daring, I confined him at home; but then he would generally break loose in my absence,

seek me among the mountains, and frequently meet me in my return. Sometimes I would tie him to a tree or a shrub, and leave him for hours: in these cases he

seemed to become a party in the implied compact between us, and waited in mute resignation till he saw me again. Every thing however was not exertion in the rambles I describe. I loitered by the side of the river, and drank in at leisure

sure the beauties that surrounded me. I sat for hours on the edge of a precipice, and considered in quiet the grand and savage objects around me, which seemed
never to have changed their character from the foundation of the world. I listened in delightful idleness to the sound of the stones, which I gently let fall

in the cavities of the rocks, or followed them with my eye as they bounded from protuberance to protuberance, till by distance they became invisible. I
stretched myself at my length along the jutting precipice, while my head hung over the vast billows of the ocean, which seemed to gape and prepare themselves

to receive me into their remorseless bosom for ever. Often I reposed by the side of a cataract, and was insensibly lulled into slumber by the monotony of its

dashings. While thus amused, I acquired a habit of being absent in mind from the

scene which was before my senses. I devoured at first with greedy appetite the objects which presented themselves; but by perseverance they faded on my eye and
my ear, and I sunk into a sweet insensibility to the impressions of external nature. The state thus produced, was sometimes that which we perhaps most
exactly
understand by the term reverie, when the mind has neither action nor distinct ideas, but is swallowed up in a living death, which, at the same time that it
is
indolent and inert, is not destitute of a certain voluptuousness. At other seasons the abstraction of my mind was of a more busy and definite sort. I was
engaged in imaginary scenes, constructed visionary plans, and found all nature subservient to my command. I had a wife or children, was the occupier of
palaces, or the ruler of nations.---There is this difference between the visions of the night, and the dreams, the waking

dreams I mean, of the day: the former are often painful, the latter are perhaps always grateful and soothing. With the visions of the night, there is
ordinarily mixed a depressing sense of impotence; things without us are too strong for us: in those of the day we are all-powerful; obstacles no sooner
present
themselves than they are conquered; or, if it is otherwise, we wilfully protract the struggle, that we may prolong our pleasure, and enhance our triumph. In

the dream of the night our powers are blunted, and we are but half ourselves: the day-dream on the contrary is the triumph of man; our invention is full, our

complacency is pure; and, if there is any mixture of imbecility or folly in the fable, it is a mixture to which the dreamer at the moment scarcely adverts. The
tendency therefore of this species of dreaming, when frequently indulged, is to inspire a certain propensity to despotism,

and to render him who admits it, impatient of opposition, and prepared to feel every cross accident, as a usurpation upon his rights, and a blot upon his
greatness. This effect of my early habits I fully experienced, and it determined the colour of my riper years. My youth however was not wholly spent in the idle and frivolous task of constructing castles in the air. The regard and affection my father felt for me,
rendered him anxious that my education should not be neglected. He hired me a private tutor. I was perhaps sufficiently fortunate in the character of the
person who was thus established in our house. He was not a clergyman. He did not shackle my mind with complex and unintelligible creeds, nor did he exhibit
that monastic coldness and squareness of character which is too frequently the result of clerical celibacy. He was however a man of morals and

of religion. But religion was distinguished in his mind more by sentiments than opinions. Whatever related to his conduct toward God or man was regulated
principally by a desire to satisfy his own conscience and obtain his own approbation, not to maintain a certain character and name in the world. He had been

designed by his parents, who were poor, for the profession of the law; but he ultimately declined this pursuit, from an aversion, as he said, to disputes,
and
sophistry, and the deriving a subsistence from the misfortunes of others. He was one of those characters, so frequently found in civilised Europe, who
imagine
in themselves a vocation to the muses, and an interest in the temple of literary immortality, which all their efforts are unable to realise. He certainly was

not a man of genius; and, though he had acquired a considerable facility in the art of rhyming, he was totally a stranger

to those more essential qualities which constitute the soul of poetry. But he was that which is better than a mere poet; he was an honest man. His heart was
guileless; his manners were simple; and, though he could never be cured of a lying estimation of his own greatness, this did not prevent him from feeling and

discharging what was due to others. He also possessed those accomplishments, the reputation of which had principally recommended him to my father's choice;
he
had a very decent portion of learning, and understood the elements of Latin, Greek, French and Italian, as well as possessed a smattering of astronomy,
natural
philosophy, mathematics and history. But his favourite study was mythology; his select reading was in Plato, at least in his translators and commentators,
which he incessantly perused, I am afraid without exactly understanding them. He had made great

progress in what I may name a concordance of all religions. This was the second basis upon which, together with his poetical effusions, he proposed to erect
the edifice of his fame. He allegorised whatever is fabulous or historical in the sacred books of all nations, and explained them all to signify a certain
sublime metaphysics, the detail of which is to be found for the most part in the writings of Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas. This was exactly the sort of tutor adapted to my dispositions. I read with him occasionally the classics, and the elementary books of science, because I was
unwilling to thwart or give any one pain, more especially my father, and because I was strongly impressed with a certain love for literature and science. But
I
studied for the most part, when I pleased. My father was contented to discern in me a certain inclination to

learning, and did not think of putting on me a task greater than I was willing to endure. In the mean time there was this peculiarity in my tuition. Though I learned from my preceptor almost every thing valuable that he was able to teach, I never
looked up to him. His foibles were obvious, and did not escape my observation. The understanding of my father was incomparably greater than that of this
inmate
of our family; nor did my father always refrain from ridiculing in his absence, and even sometimes alluding by a passing sarcasm in his presence, to my
tutor's
weaknesses. I secretly despised the good gentleman's sonnets and odes, and listened with an unattending ear to his mythological mysteries. I never dreamed
for
a moment that it could be less than sacrilege to measure his understanding with my

own. This systematical persuasion of superiority occasionally broke out into little petulancies, which did not fail grievously to wound my kind friend's
self-esteem. I was positive, assuming and conceited. But the difference of our ages prevented these disputes from having any serious consequences. If I
entertained little deference for my tutor's talents, I was not insensible to that degree of consideration which is due to superior age, particularly when
united with virtue; and my father, in his general demeanour, set me too excellent an example in this respect, for it to be possible for me not to profit by
it. I might perhaps in my own nature have been sufficiently inclined to the impetuous and turbulent; if I had been one only of a class of pupils, it is probable

enough that I should have joined in the conduct of unlucky tricks to be put upon my instructor:

but I was alone; and therefore however quick-sighted I might be to his weaknesses, they did not so expressly present themselves to my apprehension in the shape
of ridicule. The proper topic of the narrative I am writing is the record of my errors. To write it, is the act of my penitence and humiliation. I can expect however few
persons to interest themselves respecting my errors, unless they are first informed what manner of man I am, what were my spontaneous and native
dispositions,
and whether I am such a one as that my errors are worthy of commiseration and pity. This must be my apology for the topic I am here to introduce, a topic on

which all ingenuous minds are disposed to be silent, and which shall in this place be passed over as slightly as possible, my beneficence and charities. I was fond of penetrating into the cottages of the poor. I should be greatly

unjust to myself, if I suffered the reader to suppose that the wild elevation and intellectual luxuries I indulged, had the effect to render me insensible to
the miseries of man. Nothing was squalid, loathsome and disgusting in my eyes, where it was possible for me to be useful. I shrunk from the society of man in

general, and foresaw in the intercourse of my species, something for ever prepared to thwart my sensibility, and to jar against the unreal world in which I
lived. But I never shrunk from the presence of calamity. From the liberal allowance with which my father supplied me I relieved its wants, I sheltered it
from
the menaces of a prison, and I even prevailed on myself to resort willingly to such towns as our vicinity afforded, to plead its cause, and parley with its
oppressor. No doubt my pride did not come away ungratified from these enterprises. Far be it from me to assert, with certain morose and cold-blooded moralists, that our best actions are only more subtle methods by which self-love seeks its
gratification. My own heart, in every act of benevolence I ever performed, gave the lie to this execrable doctrine. I felt that it was the love of another
and
not of myself that prompted my deed; I experienced a disinterested joy in human relief and human happiness, independently of the question whether I had been

concerned in producing it; and, when the season of retrospect arrived, I exulted in my own benevolence, from the divine consciousness that, while I had been

most busily engaged in the task, my own gratification was forgotten. There is however, as I have intimated, a very subtle and complicated association in human feelings. The generous sympathy which animated my charitable deeds
was pure; it flowed from a celestial

source, and maintained its crystal current, as unmingled with the vulgar stream of personal passions, as the oil extracted from the most aromatic fruits, flows
separate and unconfounded with the mire of the kennel on which it may have fallen. There is no doubt however that the honourable character I exhibited on
these
occasions, prompted me the more joyfully to seek their repetition. Humanity and self-complacency were distinct causes of my beneficence; but the latter was
not
less powerful than the former in nourishing it into a habit. In other scenes of human intercourse I played an equal and a doubtful part; the superior
eloquence
or information of my competitor might overwhelm me; he might have more passion to pursue his purpose, or more want of feeling to harden him against the
obstacles that opposed: but in the cottage to which my benevolence led me, I appeared like

a superior nature; I had here no opposition to contend with, no insult to awaken my irritability, and no superciliousness to check the operations of my
sentiment. It was also fortunate for me, that the cases of distress which came before me in this remote part of the island, were not numerous enough to
distract my choice, or to render me callous by the too great frequency of their impressions. One adventure of this sort interested me so much by the liveliness of its incidents that I cannot refuse briefly to describe it in this place. The season had
for many days been uncommonly wet. The waters were swelled with continual rains, and the low-lands were almost inundated. It was July. After a series of
heavy
showers, one afternoon the sky brightened, the sun burst forth with redoubled splendour, and all nature smiled. This is a moment particularly

dear to the lover of rural scenery. Dry weather tarnishes the face of nature, fades the lovely colours of hill and valley, and profanes and destroys those
sweet odours which, more than any thing else, give the last finish to the charms of nature. I hastened to enjoy the golden opportunity. By long practice I
knew
how to find the paths where mire and swamps would not occur to interrupt my pleasure. My way led me by a steep acclivity of the mountain, which overhangs the

bason that forms the source of the Desunny. I gained the eastern extremity of the ridge, that I might the more amply enjoy the beams of the setting sun as he

sunk beneath the waves of the Irish sea. It was the finest evening my eyes ever beheld. The resplendent colours of the clouds, the rich purple and burnished

gold in various streaks fantastically formed and repeated, were beyond any imagination to conceive. The

woods were vocal. The scents that surrounded me, the steaming earth, the fresh and invigorating air, the hay and the flowers, constituted, so to express
myself, an olfactory concert, infinitely more ravishing than all the concords of harmonious sound that human art ever produced. This lovely moment combined
in
one impression the freshness of the finest morning, with all the rich and gorgeous effects peculiar to the close of a summer's day. I stood, as I have said, on the edge of the precipice. I gazed for a long time upon the various charms, that what we ordinarily, but improperly, call inanimate
nature unfolded. I saw the rustic, as he retired from endeavouring to repair the injury his hay had sustained, and the flocks, as they passed slowly along to

their evening's repose. Presently an individual object engrossed my attention. A young lamb had wandered by

some accident to the middle of the precipice, and a peasant was pursuing it, and endeavouring to call it to his arms. I shuddered at the sight. The precipice
was in some parts almost perpendicular. The rains had rendered the surface exceedingly slippery. The peasant caught at the shrubs and tufts of grass as he
descended; and, with a skill peculiar to the inhabitants of the mountains, seemed to proceed securely in the most desperate places. The lamb, whether from
heedlessness or wantonness, advanced further along the mountain-side, as the shepherd pursued. While I was engaged in observing this little manoeuvre, I suddenly heard a scream. It came from a spot exceedingly near to me. Two boys sat in a nook where I
had not perceived them, and cried out, My brother! my brother! A venerable grey-headed man was with them. He exclaimed, My son! my

William! and prepared to plunge down the precipice. The scream I had heard was the effect of what at that moment happened before my eyes; yet such is the
curious structure of the human senses, that what I heard seemed to be prior in time to what I saw. The peasant had almost overtaken his lamb. The lamb was on

the point of escaping by a sudden leap; the peasant sprung upon him, and both were at the bottom of the precipice, and plunged in the bason, now swelled into
a
lake, with the rapidity of lightning. I flew to the groupe I have described; I laid hold of the old man at the moment of his purposed descent; I cried out,
"Stay, poor man! what can you do? I will save your son!" I knew a path, more secure, yet scarcely more circuitous than that which the peasant had followed. I

had the advantage over him, that I was not diverted from my course by any object

whose deviations I pursued. For some time I went on safely; I saw the peasant rise to the surface of the water, and sink again; my impatience was too great to
combine any longer with wariness; I lost my footing, and in an instant I also was in the lake. My fall had been from a less terrible height than his, and I recovered myself. I swam toward the place where he had last sunk; he rose; I threw my arm round
his neck, and supported him. The difficulty however which remained appeared insuperable; the shores on almost every side were shelving, and impossible to be

scaled with the peasant in my arms, who was in a state of insensibility. As I was endeavouring to find the means of escaping from this difficulty, I saw a
boat
advancing toward us; it was rowed by a young woman; it approached; she was William's mistress, and the owner of the lamb for

which he had ventured his life; we got him into the boat; he was more stunned with the fall, than injured by the water; he appeared to be gradually recovering;
even the lamb was saved. By the time we had reached the shore, the father and the two brothers were come round to our landing-place. All their attention was at first turned upon
William; I was nothing to them; I retired to a little distance, and observed the groupe. The eldest boy supported William, as he sat; the blooming maid
rubbed
his temples; the father sat before him, and clasped his son's hands between his. It was an interesting spectacle; a painter might have sketched them as they

sat. The eyes of the boy glistened with eagerness; the girl hung over her lover, while her colour alternately changed from its natural ruddiness to a languid

paleness; the hairs of the old man were as white as snow. Presently

William uttered a profound sigh; it was a welcome sound to the whole assembly. The least boy was at first wrapped in silent attention; but presently began to
play with Molly, the pet lamb, that frisked about him. In a short time the old man exclaimed, Where is our deliverer? It was now my turn; I was at a short
distance; they were all tumultuous in their expressions of gratitude. The peasant-girl and myself supported William to his cottage; I offered my other arm to

the father; the biggest boy led their favourite lamb by a string which hung from his neck; the youngest bore in triumph his father's stick, who, as he leaned

on my arm, no longer needed its support. Such was the commencement of my acquaintance with an honest family. The habitation of the girl was at a small distance from theirs; she was one of a numerous
assemblage of sisters who lived

with their mother. I found that the young persons had been lovers for more than a year, but had deferred their marriage for prudential reasons. The industry of
William was the support of his own house; his father was past his labour; they had resolved not to marry till the next brother should be able to take the
place
now filled by the eldest. The accident that had just occurred, in which the cottage-maid preserved the life of her lover, increased their affection, and
doubled their impatience; an impatience however which they were resolute to subject to the most honourable considerations. I saw them often; I loved them
much. William was ingenuous and active; the maid added to a masculine intrepidity most of the more lovely graces of her own sex. The father often lamented, even
with
tears, that he was no longer capable of those exertions which might enable William

freely to obey the dictates of his heart. The attachment which I felt to them was that of a patron and a preserver; when I observed the degree of content which
prevailed among them, when I witnessed the effusions of their honest esteem and affection, my heart whispered me, This would not have existed, but for me! I

prevailed on my father to bestow a farm upon the lovers; I engaged, out of my own little stock, to hire a labourer for the old man; they married, and I had
the
satisfaction to convert one virtuous establishment into two. Such were the principal occupations of my juvenile years. I loved the country, without feeling any partiality to what are called the sports of the country. My
temper, as I have already said, was somewhat unsocial, and so far as related to the intercourse of my species, except when some strong stimulus of humanity
called me into action, unenterprising. I was therefore no hunter. I was inaccessible to the pitiful ambition of showing, before a gang of rural squires, that I had a fine horse, and could manage him
gracefully. I had not the motive, which ordinarily influences the inhabitants of the country to the cultivation of these sports, the want of occupation. I
was
young: the world was new to me: I abounded with occupation. In the scenery of Merionethshire I found a source of inexhaustible amusement. Science, history,
poetry, engaged me by turns, and into each of them by turns my soul plunged itself with an ardour difficult to describe. In the train of these came my
visions,
my beloved and variegated inventions, the records, which to me appeared voluminous and momentous, of my past life, the plans of my future, the republics I
formed, the seminaries of education for which I constructed laws,

the figure I proposed hereafter to exhibit in the eyes of a wondering world. I had a still further and more direct reason for my rejection of the sports of the
field. I could not with patience regard torture, anguish and death, as the sources of my amusement. My natural temper, or my reflective and undebauched
habits
as a solitaire, prevented me from overlooking the brutality and cruelty of such pursuits. In very early youth I had been seduced, first by a footman of my
father, and afterward by my tutor, who was a great lover of the art, to join in an excursion of angling. But, after a short trial, I abjured the amusement
for
ever; and it was one among the causes of the small respect I entertained for my tutor, that he was devoted to so idle and unfeeling an avocation. At the usual age I entered myself of the university of Oxford. I felt no strong propensity to this change; but I submitted to it, as to a thing in the regular
order of proceeding, and to which it would be useless to object. I was so much accustomed to self-conversation as to have little inclination to mix in the
world, and was to such a degree satisfied with my abilities, and progress, and capacity of directing my own studies and conduct, as not to look with any
eager
craving for the advice and assistance of professors and doctors. In setting out for the university I was to part with my father and my preceptor. The first of these was a bitter pang to me; I had scarcely from the earliest
of

my remembrance ever been a week removed from the sight of the author of my being. He was the wisest and the best man I knew. He had all those advantages from
nature, and from the external endowments of fortune, which were calculated to maintain my reverence. We had gradually become more qualified for each other's

society and confidence. Our characters had many points of resemblance: we were both serious, both contemplative, both averse to the commerce of the world. My

temper, as I have said, was to an uncommon degree impatient of contradiction; and a certain degree of heart-burning had not failed occasionally to invade my

breast on this score, even toward this excellent parent. But my resentment and indignation in these instances had been short-lived. As the only
representative
of his person in existence, my father was ardently attached

to me, and the occasions he administred to my impatience and displeasure were exceedingly few. On the other hand, whatever faults of character might justly be
imputed to me, I had yet betrayed no tokens of an unmanageable boisterousness; my propensities were innocent; and my pursuits, most of them, such as seemed
to
conduce to the improvement of my understanding and my heart. In a word, my father and I, allowing for those failings which in some form or other are
inseparable from the human character, were excellent friends; and it was not without many tears shed on both sides, that we parted when I mounted the chaise
in
which I set out for Oxford. The separation between me and my tutor, which took place at the same time, was productive of a mixed sensation. I had long nourished in my mind a supercilious
disregard of his mental

discernment, and felt as if it were a degradation to me to listen to his instructions. The lessons he gave me appeared as a sort of shackles, the symbols of
infantine imbecility. I was confident of my virtue and my perseverance, and longed to shake off these tokens of my nonage. But, beside these intellectual
sources of weariness and impatience, there was an animal sensation, which made me regard the day of my separation from my tutor as the epoch of my liberty. His
voice was sickly and unpleasing to my ear. He had cultivated the art of being amiable; and his cadences were formed by habit to a kind of tune of candour and

gentleness and humanity. His gentleness was unfortunately twin-brother to the softness of his understanding, and expressed nothing so plainly as his
ignorance
of all the avenues of persuasion, and all the secret springs of hope, and fear, and

passion, and will. In addition to this, the good gentleman loved to hear himself talk; and his explanations and exhortations were as long as the homilies of
archbishop Cranmer. At my age, the age of restlessness and activity and enterprise, these discourses unhappily did not generate a propensity to sleep, and
therefore produced in me an insupportable listlessness and ennui. Yet I did not finally part with my old friend without pain. It was impossible a more innocent creature should live. If I did not highly respect him, I could
not help approving and loving him. Had it been otherwise, there is something in the nature of habit, which will for ever prevent us from parting with that to

which we have been long accustomed, with indifference. I had been used to see my preceptor every morning. He was part of the furniture of our eating-room. As

we had very unfrequent

opportunities of various society, I often found relief in entering into conversation with him. If he could tell me nothing that appeared to me highly worthy of
attention, in the way of fancy or deduction, he was at least well qualified to inform me of what he had read in books, relatively either to chronology,
geography or science. I am persuaded that, if, when my tutor left me, I had remained among the same scenes, the crisis would have been a severe one. As it
was,
my understanding approved of the separation; I recollected that it was an event for which I had often and anxiously sighed; yet to part with a good man, a
man
to whose cares and patience I owed much, who had bestowed on me a thousand benefits, and between whom and myself there had, from familiarity, grown up a
considerable affection, was no desirable task. I kissed his hand; I thanked him a hundred

times for his constant exertions; with bitter self-reproach I intreated him to forgive every act of rudeness, impetuousness and disrespect, I had been guilty
of toward him: at this moment these things struck upon my conscience like crimes. My father was anxious that a decent provision should be made for his declining years. There was an ecclesiastical living of considerable value vacant in my
father's gift, and he intreated my tutor to enter into holy orders, and accept of it. But this my old friend strenuously declined. His creed did not exactly

accord with the principles of orthodoxy contained in the code of the church of England; and he disdained to compromise with his conscience. Besides,
regarding
himself, as he undoubtedly did, as the first luminary of his age, he could not think with perfect temper of devoting the last maturity of his mind

to the society of fox-hunting squires, and the reading prayers and sermons to rustics and old women. He retired, upon a small annuity which my father settled
upon him, to a narrow lodging in an obscure street of the metropolis, and published from time to time pocket volumes of poetry, and sketches of a synopsis of

his mythological discoveries, which some persons bought out of respect to the good qualities of their author, but which no person read. A third separation which took place on this occasion, and which I hope the reader will not think it beneath the dignity of history to record, was between me
and my dog. He was my old and affectionate friend, and the hours I had spent t�te � t�te in his society were scarcely less numerous than those I had spent
with
my tutor. He had often been the confident of my sorrows; and I had not found it less natural to complain

to him, than the heroines of fable or romance to the woods and the wilds, the rocks and the occean, of the cruelties they experienced, or the calamities that
weighed them down to the earth. One instance in particular I remember in very early youth, when my father had spoken to me with unusual sharpness, about some

fault that in my eyes by no means merited great severity of censure. I retired to the terrace in the garden which has already been mentioned, threw myself at

my length upon the turf, and indulged a short fit of mutiny and misanthropy. As I lay, poor Chilo (that was the dog's name) discovered me, and leaped toward
me
with his usual demonstrations of joy. I was in too ill a humour to notice him; and he, who seemed to have at least as much skill as my tutor in discerning
what
passed in my mind, crept along the turf toward the spot which supported my

head, with pleading and most diffident advances. At length I suffered my eye to fall on him. This brought him close to me in a moment. He licked my hands and
my face, with every token of gratitude, affection and delight. I threw my arms round him. Fond fool! said I, every one else treats me with unkindness and
injustice; but you will love me still! It was judged proper that this animal, who had passed the meridian of his life, should not accompany me in my entrance into the world, but should remain at
home. I accordingly left him in Merionethshire. What was my surprise then, one day as I came down the steps of the chapel from morning prayers, after having

been a week at Oxford, at meeting my dog! He fawned upon me, played a thousand extravagant antics, and was transported out of himself at the joy of finding
me. I afterward learned that he had been at my rooms, had been repulsed there, and finally found his way to the chapel. By what sort of instinct an animal is thus
enabled, for a distance of one hundred and seventy miles, to discover the trace of his master, I am unable to say. The thing itself I am told is not
uncommon. But every ingenuous mind to whom such an incident has occurred, feels, no doubt, as I did, a most powerful impulse of affection toward the brute who has
shown
so distinguished an attachment. What is the nature of this attachment? A dog, I believe, is not less attached to a fool than to a wise man, to a peasant than to a lord, to a beggar inhabiting
the poorest hut, than to a prince swaying the sceptre of nations and dwelling in a palace. Ill usage scarcely makes a difference. At least the most sparingly

dealt kindness of the surliest

groom affords a sufficient basis of attachment. The case is considerably parallel to that of a nobleman I have somewhere read of, who insisted that his
mistress should not love him for his wealth nor his rank, the graces of his person nor the accomplishments of his mind, but for himself. I am inclined to
blame
the man who should thus subtly refine, and wantonly endeavour at a separation between him and all that is most truly his: but, where the course of nature
produces this separation, there is a principle in the human mind which compels us to find gratification in this unmerited and metaphysical love. At Oxford the whole tone of my mind became speedily changed. The situation was altogether new, and the effects produced were strikingly opposed to those which
I had hitherto sustained. In Merionethshire I had been a solitary savage. I had no companions, and I

desired none. The commerce of my books and of my thoughts was enough for me. I lived in an ideal world of my own creation. The actual world beneath me I
intuitively shunned. I felt that every man I should meet would be either too ignorant, too coarse, or too supercilious, to afford me pleasure. The strings of

my mind, so to express it, were tuned to too delicate and sensitive a pitch: it was an Eolian harp, upon which the winds of heaven might "discourse excellent

music;" but the touch of a human hand could draw from it nothing but discord and dissonance. At the university all that I experienced for some weeks was pain. Nature spoils us for relishing the beauties of nature. Formed as my mind had been, almost
from infancy, to delight itself with the grand, the romantic, the pregnant, the surprising, and the stupendous, as they display themselves in

North Wales, it is inconceivable with what contempt, what sensations of loathing, I looked upon the face of nature as it shows itself in Oxfordshire. All here
was flat and tame and tedious. Wales was nature in the vigour and animation of youth: she sported in a thousand wild and admirable freaks; she displayed a
master-hand; every stroke of her majestic pencil was clear, and bold, and free. But, in the country to which I had now removed, nature to my eyes seemed to
be
in her dotage; if she attempted any thing, it was the attempt of a driveller; she appeared like a toothless and palsied beldame, who calls upon her visitors
to
attend, who mumbles slowly a set of inarticulate and unintelligible sounds, and to whom it exceeds the force of human resolution to keep up the forms of
civility. Why does the world we live in, thus teach us to despise the world? My father's house had been built in a style of antique magnificence. The apartments were spacious, the galleries long and wide, and the hall in which I was
accustomed to walk in unfavourable weather, was of ample dimensions. The rooms appropriated to my use at Oxford appeared comparatively narrow, squalid and
unwholsome. My very soul was cabined in them. There were spacious buildings in Oxford; there were open and cheerful walks: but how contrasted with those to
which I had been accustomed! There I expatiated free; I possessed them alone; Nature was my friend, and my soul familiarly discoursed with her, unbroken in
upon by the intrusion of the vulgar and the profane. Here I had no green and heaven-formed retreat in which I could hide myself; my path was crossed by boys;
I
was elbowed by gownmen; their vulgar gabble and light laughter

perpetually beset my ears, and waked up curses in my soul. I could pursue no train of thought; the cherished visions of my former years were broken and
scattered in a thousand fragments. I know that there are men who could pursue an undivided occupation of thought amidst all the confusion of Babel; but my
habits had not fitted me for this. I had had no difficulties to struggle with; and I was prepared to surmount none. The morning of life is pliable and docile. I speedily adapted myself to my situation. As I could not escape from the coxcombs of the university, I surrendered
myself with the best grace I could into their hands. It is the first step only that costs a struggle. At the commencement the savage of Merionethshire made
but
an uncouth and ludicrous figure among the pert youngsters of Oxford. Their speech and gestures

were new to me. I had hitherto spent more words, the repetition of lessons only excepted, in soliloquy than in conversation. My phrases were those of
enthusiasm and the heart. They had the full and pregnant form which was given them by a mind crowded with ideas and impelled to unload itself, not the sharp,

short, pointed turn of a speaker whose habitual object is a jest. My muscles were not formed to a smile; or, if at any time they had assumed that expression,

it was the smile of elevated sentiment, not that of supercilious contempt, of petty triumph, or convivial jollity. As soon however as I had chosen my part in the dilemma before me, I became instinct with a principle, from which the mind of ingenuous youth is never totally
free, the principle of curiosity. I was prompted to observe these animals, so different from any that had been before

presented to my view, to study their motives, their propensities and their tempers, the passions of their souls, and the occupations of their intellect. To do
this effectually, it was necessary that I should become familiar with many, and intimate with a few. I entered myself an associate of their midnight orgies,

and selected one young person for a friend, who kindly undertook my introduction into the world. It happened in this, as in all cases of a similar nature, that familiarity annihilated wonder. As the hero is no hero to his valet-de-chambre , so the monster
is no monster to his friend. Through all the varieties of the human race, however unlike in their prominent features, there are sufficient chords of
sympathy,
and evidences of a common nature, to enable us to understand each other, and find out the clue to every seeming irregularity. I soon felt that my new
associates

were of the same species as myself, and that the passions which stimulated them, had seeds of a responsive class, however hitherto unadverted to and
undeveloped, in my own bosom. It is surprising how soon I became like to the persons I had so lately wondered at and despised. Nothing could be more opposite, in various leading respects,
than the Fleetwood of Merionethshire and the Fleetwood of the university. The former had been silent and apparently sheepish, not perhaps more from
awkwardness
than pride. He was contemplative, absent, enthusiastical, a worshipper of nature. His thoughts were full of rapture, elevation and poetry. His eyes now held

commerce with the phenomena of the heavens, and now were bent to earth in silent contemplation and musing. There was nothing in them of the level and
horizontal. His bosom beat with the flattering

consciousness, that he was of a class superior to the ordinary race of man. It was impossible to be of a purer nature, or to have a soul more free from every
thing gross, sordid and groveling. The Fleetwood of the university had lost much of this, and had exchanged the generous and unsullied pride of the wanderer,

for a pride of a humbler cast. Once I feared not the eye of man, except as I was reluctant to give him pain; now I was afraid of ridicule. This very fear
made
me impudent. I hid the qualms and apprehensiveness of my nature, under "a swashing and a martial outside." My jest was always ready. I willingly engaged in
every scheme of a gay and an unlucky nature. I learned to swallow my glass freely, and to despise the character of a flincher. I carefully stored my memory
with convivial and licentious songs, and learned to sing them in a manner that caused the

walls of our supper-room to echo with thunders of applause. Here, as in Wales, I advanced toward the summit of the class of character to which I devoted my
ambition, and was acknowledged by all my riotous companions for an accomplished pickle. In the contrast of the two personages I have described, I confess my

memory has no hesitation on which side to determine her preference. Oh, Cader Idris! oh, genius of the mountains!
