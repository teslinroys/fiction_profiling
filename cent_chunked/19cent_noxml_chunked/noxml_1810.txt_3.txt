In Sir Edward he found the stanch patriot, blended with the ardent and zealous
servant of the throne; keenly alive both to the interests of his country and his sovereign;
the strenuous supporter of darling liberty, Britain's peculiar privilege, but one of faction's
bitterest and most implacable foes: the tear of philanthropy glistened in the worthy
Baronet's eye, as he proposed for a toast-that virtuous senator who had so nobly stepped
forward in parliament for the relief of insolvent debtors; had unbarred, through his
generous exertions, the doors of their prisons, and restored the long confined husband to
the arms of an affectionate wife, and many a father to his afflicted children! Charles was engaged with the Rector in listening to the most flattering promises of
military promotion; the disposition of Charles was sanguine, and he believed all his noble
patron uttered. Sir Charles Sefton and Ralph were two to one against Sir John Wringham,
in favour of the former being a man of more consequence, and a more useful member of
society than the lawyer; whilst the little man contended, that without the protection of the
law the farms would soon be destroyed, however wealthy, and the rich property seized on
by whoever should choose to lay hands on them, and that, without law, might would be
sure to overcome right. Sir Edward Harrington paid no attention to their arguments, but frequently eyed the
Honourable and Reverend Theodore Leslie with contempt, and listened to what he was
convinced were the most egregious falsehoods; for the situations which he promised to
ensure to Charles, Sir Edward knew had been long given away, and that this the Rector
knew also as well as himself. On the proposed toast, however, being repeated, Mr. Leslie
said, "Oh! aye, I was so engaged with my worthy veteran here, that I did not attend to
you, Sir Edward; here's to your old quiz of a virtuous Baronet; and come, now for my
toast,-Colonel Wardle!" A general silence prevailed, and an unanimous resolution
seemed to be formed not to do honour to the toast, which was first boldly declared by Sir
Edward Harrington; Sir Charles Sefton, however, and little Sir John Wringham, drank it;
the latter, like a cunning lawyer, saying, that whatever dislike any person might have
against another, he ought never to object to such toasts as the master of the house pleased
to give. "So, sir," said Sir Edward, "then if it is the master's pleasure, I am to drink,
perhaps, success to Napoleon Buonaparte, and also to the public defender of a woman of
a certain description, which defenders are vulgarly called bullies: no, gentlemen, I never
will toast the man I despise; the leader of any thing bordering on faction, I shall ever hold
in the most abject contempt:" and seeing his nephew raise his glass to his lips, he added,
"If Frederic drinks that toast, I cast him off for ever!" "Pardon me, sir," said Frederic, "not even you should make me retract a sentiment
which my inward conscience approves and assures me is right; and I solemnly declare,
that not even you should compel me to drink it; and I pressed the sparkling wine to my lip
in veneration of your last sentiment." "I was in Ireland," said Sir Edward, "a short time ago, and it was proposed at a little
town a short distance from Dublin, to vote an address of thanks to Colonel Wardle; an
honest clergyman, however, an intelligent, loyal, and well-informed man, was against it;
but most votes carried the day, and his arguments were over-ruled. "Well, then," said he,


with all that quickness of ready wit which characterises the Irish nation, "I vote that a
piece of the finest and whitest Irish linen be sent also as a present to Colonel Wardle, with
this pious wish, that "HE MAY NEVER SULLY IT IN THE LAP OF INFAMY! "*
"Aye, you're all a set of fine fellows," said the Rector, "and so, come, a truce to this
nonsense, curse Wardle, hang me if I care one pin for him." Sir Edward seeing the reverend pillar of the church not very steady, proposed that
they should all repair to the drawing-room and join the ladies; but in this he was
absolutely over-ruled by the Rector, who insisted on their taking one more bottle, and
then they would all adjourn together. There have been instances of a man drinking himself sober; and one of the kind
appeared now exemplified in Mr. Leslie, who after finishing the best part of the insisted
bottle, followed the gentlemen up stairs, and partook of the coffee handed round to the
ladies with all the elegant ease of a man of fashion; and though his cheek glowed with the
fever of a bacchanalian, yet his manners in presence of the ladies, though very gay, were
by no means indecorous, or wearing the stamp of inebriety. A turn in the gardens was carelessly proposed by Lady Caroline Leslie, before the
dancing began; and the agreeable surprise of a Vauxhall in miniature met the astonished
eyes of the guests: coloured lamps, in appropriate devices, were entwined round the
ancient oaks, and that defence of Britain, at the entrance of the park, was guarded by three
of the Rector's servants, arrayed in the dress of the ancient Druids! Mary was enchanted
with a scene so novel and tasteful, and Margaret now saw realized before her eyes all that
she had hitherto been taught to regard as fiction only: "Oh!" said she, as she hung on the
arm of the quizzing Sir Charles Sefton, "how often has my rustic uncle and rigid father
declared, that such brilliant sights as these existed only in the poet's imagination, or in the
fanciful brain of the writer of a fairy-tale! Surely, those three venerable beings are the
genii who preside over this delightful region! and I tread only now on enchanted ground!" "Your uncle, my intelligent angel," said Sir Charles, "your uncle Ralph is a mere
rustic indeed; your uncle Charles is very well; your father I must revere, because it is
supposed that he gave being to so divine a creature as yourself: I say, so it is generally
supposed; but oh! incomparable Margaritta, I could say, what indeed I dare scarcely utter
to delicacy like thine! but-surely,-surely,-my seraph, those sublime rays of genius
which you possess could never have entered the mind of the daughter of a country curate! impossible, impossible; I own, pardon my temerity, I own I cannot help thinking that the
child of some noble or royal dame has been exchanged by some vile nurse for that of the
curate, and that Margaritta is that high-born fair-one!" The company were now strolling about in pairs; and but little attention was paid to
our two country girls, except by Margaret's unremitting shadow, Sir Charles Sefton, who
had received his instructions from the fair quality idol to whom he was devoted. Soft music was heard at a distance: Mary, no critical amateur, but an untaught
enthusiast, was all ear; lost in the sweet reverie which the melodious strains inspired, she
suffered herself to be taken by the hand and led towards the place whence the sounds
proceeded; she soon became sensible of her situation, and dreaded to turn her head,
convinced in her own mind she should behold the libertine Rector, when a voice
*Historique. addressed her, full of magic sweetness, saying, "Again am I made happy, by guiding Miss
Marsham in her wanderings." "Indeed, sir," replied Mary, "my wanderings, as you justly call them, have the
appearance of wilful and thoughtless errors: suffer me now, sir, to return to the company,
I can easily retrace my way without a guide;" and withdrawing her hand, she turned from
him with a grave curtsey; when Frederic, hastily, though respectfully, taking hold of her
robe, said, "Oh! Miss Marsham, leave me not thus; I sought you out to explain a conduct
to you, which I am obliged this night to preserve, and which gives real anguish to my
feelings: I am forbidden to-to pay any attention to you-and requested not to dance with
you-by-" "And what, sir," interrupted the half-offended Mary, "could make you
imagine that such conduct would be of any consequence to me? The little instruction I
have had in dancing, will make me rather desirous of declining it among so polished and
scientific a circle; and whoever, sir, chooses to restrict you, has, no doubt, justifiable
motives; nor can your neglect of me require any apology, as it is a matter of indifference
to me." At this last sentence, uttered with an aching heart, she hastily quitted him, and
turned down a shadowy walk, which was only partially lighted, to hide her vexation. "It
is," thought she, "the proud Sir Edward, his uncle, who has put these restrictions upon
him; yet how deceitful are appearances! with how much benevolence, with how much
paternal kindness did he look upon me! His smiles bespoke approbation, gentleness, and
every thing that was beneficent and amiable, each time he chanced to meet my eyes: oh! world of fashion and deceit, how much I have seen of you, in only the space of a few
hours!" She now heard a mingled tumult of voices, and beheld through the trees the welldressed
crowd moving in various directions; the rockets and fiery serpents whizzed in the
air; and as she stopped to gaze at the breaking splendour of the former, she felt herself
suddenly clasped round the waist, and embraced with energy and rudeness, by the
Honourable and Reverend Theodore Leslie! With a strength almost supernatural, she pushed him from her, and having
disengaged herself from his hold, ran like a frightened fawn along the walk, till she
reached a roomy alcove at the farthest end; unknowing where she went, she was hastily
about to enter it, when the soft sighs of a female met her ear, mingled with the following
words: "Oh! Harrington, you are too dangerous; oh! let us leave this alluring spot; come
with me, I intreat you, this instant, to see the fire-works; what will be thought of our
absence? "-"Cruel Isabella," returned the inconsiderate Harrington, "think, oh! think
only of that ardent fire which consumes your Frederic! think of the flame those
bewitching eyes have kindled! The mind of my Isabel, rising superior to public opinion,
disclaims the world and all its rigid forms." Shocked, abashed at what she heard, poor Mary knew not how to act; but the
pursuing footsteps of the Rector made her resolve to enter the harbour; and oh! thought
she, perhaps I shall save the indiscreet Lady Isabella from ruin! Mary was not one of the fainting kind, but her severe agitation, the conviction of
Harrington's being a libertine, the person who laid her arbitrary restraints upon him, now
before her, caused an ashy paleness to overspread her countenance: shocked at her deathlike
appearance, Harrington, in spite of Lady Isabella, flew to her aid; at the same time
franticly exclaiming, "For God's sake, Lady Isabella, if you have your vinaigrette in your


pocket, give it me to relieve this charming girl; do you see the situation she is in? The
explosion of the fire-works, no doubt, has terrified her." "Do you think, sir," said Lady Isabella, "that I wear pockets? I leave you, Miss
Marsham, in very good hands," added she, rising, "and will send one of the servants with
a glass of water to you, which I dare say will be of more service to a country girl than
aromatic vinegar!" Frederic pressed the trembling Mary to his heart; but she, shuddering at his touch,
insisted on his leaving her immediately, as she felt quite recovered: he fell on his knees
before her, pressed her hand to his lips, and exclaimed, "Oh! how can I ever regain the
good opinion of Miss Marsham? "-"My opinion, sir," said Mary, with dignity, "is of very
little consequence to any one; and as to your regaining mine, I surely, sir, have not known
you long enough to form any of you; but if you would wish me to think you obliging, I
desire you will quit me instantly, or suffer me to depart: the termination of this walk, I
see, leads to another which is crowded with company, and them I shall join, as I see my
father and uncles are among them." The confused Harrington, not a little mortified, suffered her to depart, and mentally
cursed his stars, that had suffered his licentiousness to reach the ear of purity, and had
implanted, perhaps, aversion in the breast of that woman (who though only the daughter
of a poor country curate) he was most ambitious should think of him favourably. It has been before remarked, that the bewitching Lady Isabella had made a temporary
kind of conquest over the senses, and had shaken the principles of Frederic Harrington;
over his heart and mind she had no claim. Elevated with champaign, and tied for the
whole day and evening at her side, her animation, her beauty, and the opportunities she
carelessly and almost purposely gave him, caused the scene which the pure and spotless
Mary had, undesignedly witnessed. The free-thinking Isabella, however, by no means felt
obliged at thus being rescued from the destruction of one mad moment; yet though her
principles were dissolute, she had refinement in her love, and must possess the heart as
well as the person of her lover: her good sense soon shewed her, as conviction flashed on
her mind, that the inclination of Harrington towards her, was little more than sensual; the
haste in which he quitted her to succour Mary-the scene in the morning-his frequent
and animated looks during dinner-time towards Miss Marsham, made her now, as she
revolved each circumstance over in her mind, lay plans for a scheme she was determined
to put in practice. The fireworks over, the party were summoned to the ball-room by Lady Caroline:
habited as Terpsichore, she tripped with grace and gaiety before her admiring guests, and
they entered a spacious saloon, illuminated with wax-lights to a degree of dazzling
splendour. Lady Isabella, entirely mistress of herself, aided as much as possible the
reconciliation of Harrington and Mary; but Mary was, at times, either pensive or distraite;
and not all the soft and delicate attentions of Frederic could reinstate him in her favour:
the more he endeavoured to regain it, the more specious and dangerous he appeared to
her, and caused her to be the more circumspect. Alas! she little knew the great world, and
how often at war with the heart and conscience, is the free indulgence of the senses, from
the fatal misfortune of being introduced to that world of dissipation too early: she knew
not, that in spite of promiscuous attachments, how deep were the impressions made by


virtue and goodness, though often only at a first interview; she knew not how, actuating
on the baser principles and weakness of human nature, refined sophistry and artful
fascinations too often succeeded in their aim, without entirely extinguishing the pure
flame of moral rectitude. "I was engaged to dance with you, Frederic," said Lady Isabella, with the most
seducing freedom, and apparent good humour, "but I am a capricious creature; I treat you
as one of our family; not for the world would I treat you with rudeness, but I have found
an old acquaintance here, whom I promised to dance with at the first ball we should
chance to meet at;" at the same moment she gave her hand to a young Major, who was
quartered in the village: This young man, of a noble family, but small fortune, had been a
great favourite with Lady Isabella, before she saw the all-subduing Harrington; and, till
she consented to repair the shattered fortune of her family, by a marriage with Sir Charles
Sefton, had been much shunned by all the Leslies; but now he again became a welcome
guest at their crowded parties; en famille, he was never invited, for fear of Lady Isabella's
former penchant returning in the tranquil and interesting conversations of parties
quarr�es, &c. &c.
She formed the ill-natured resolution now, of aiding Harrington's affections with
Mary, raising his expectations to the height of happiness, and then destroying them for
ever! Bewitched by her syren arts, Harrington could not forbear repining at her caprice;
and much nettled, said, "I once thought Lady Isabella as polite as she is lovely! but even
to her fancies, she shall ever find me her willing slave," and bowing obsequiously, he
solicited Mary to accept him for a partner. Mary had ever been fond of dancing, her father and uncles came up to her, enquired
the cause of her refusing the honour Mr. Harrington did her? "No," said Sir Edward, "let
me plead for my nephew, for the honour will be his." Over-ruled, and not being artful
enough to affect indisposition, she suffered herself to be led amongst the gay throng who
were just, after having danced "THE SELF," commencing a second dance. Mary figured
not away, with every different pas � l'Ecossois, neither did she twist her body about, with
all the studied graces of an Italian figurante; but the elasticity of her charming form, her
own natural elegance, her animation and true ear to every note, gave a kind of skill to her
movements, which astonished the scientific dancers, who composed the modern part of
the gay assembly. Margaret did not like dancing, and danced, whenever she attempted it, vilely; but
wrought upon by the persuasions of Sir Charles Sefton, to the surprise and vexation of her
sister, father and uncles, she stood up; she swam about the room with her head
languishing on one side, and put every one out in the figure; for amongst all Margaret's
defects, she had that of never knowing one tune from another; quick or slow, it was all the
same to her: yet Sir Charles, like the fox in the fable, would, had he thought proper, have
induced the silly girl, like the vain crow-to sing! Towards the hour of two, they all adjourned to an elegant supper; and yet Harrington
could not (with all his admiration of Mary, and though Lady Isabella gave him every
encouragement to notice her,) conquer the pride of birth, and the opinion of the world,
sufficiently, to seat himself beside her; notwithstanding, he thought her superior to every
female there. His eyes and his willing feet followed Lady Isabella; and his uncle gave him


a rebuke, by taking the hand of the lovely girl his nephew had just quitted, saying aloud,
"Will Miss Marsham allow me the honour of waiting on her at supper?" Lady Isabella accepted all the pointed attentions of Major Raymond, and did not so
much as once turn her eyes towards the mortified Frederic: but Lady Caroline said to him,
"Harrington, sit by me; here, I will make room for you; I shall not allow you to dance any
more, for I just want one to complete my set at vingt-un; and must positively lay my
commands on you. "-"The commands of your ladyship are to me laws, which I am happy
to obey," said Harrington, with forced politeness; and attending her after the supper was
over, to the card-table, left the remainder of the company to re-commence their dancing. Mary danced no more, but was gratified by the pleasing attention of Sir Edward
Harrington, with whom she supported a sensible and interesting conversation; and the
Baronet felt for Mary all the tender warmth of paternal friendship. Just after the clock had struck four, a violent bustle was heard in the card-room: Lady
Caroline was in violent hysterics; Harrington, pale, and in evident distress of mind,
supported her in his arms: some of the party appeared to sneer, and one lady seemed, in a
determined manner, to insist on payment. With this lady, a female gambler of quality, who had come down to her country seat,
a few miles off, and had this evening accepted the invitation of the Leslies, Harrington
had imprudently entered into a gallant kind of partnership at the vingt-un table, and Lady
Caroline, in the true spirit of play, had delighted in laying enormous bets of beating two
against one: at length she had gambled away infinitely more than she was able to pay;
Harrington would willingly have excused her all, but the partnership he had entered into,
besides the little money he had left, from the preposterous loan he had made in the
morning, rendered it impracticable. The Reverend Mr. Leslie, however, with the aid of the indignant Sir Edward
Harrington, restored a momentary comfort to the mind of her ladyship; but the look Sir
Edward gave his nephew, seemed to pierce him to the heart, while that of Mr. Leslie, to
his wife, was no less replete with wrath; but for that she cared but little. The festivity of the scene being now much clouded, and the morning sun having shot
its bright rays on both natural and artificial beauty, Lady Caroline retired, and each party
seemed desirous of departing. Harrington was missing at the same time as her ladyship; and Mary, who was
doomed to be a spectator of all that could agonize her feelings, beheld, as she passed
through a suite of rooms to fetch her shawl from the apartment in which she had left it,
from a door which stood half open, Harrington on his knees before Lady Caroline Leslie! He was pressing her extended hand to his bosom, and these words distinctly met her
ear, as Lady Caroline bent towards him, "Oh! too persuasive Harrington, you have
conquered!" Mary had heard enough, not only to be convinced of the licentiousness, but the
baseness of Frederic's principles; she saw but too plain, that he was now ungenerous
enough to take advantage of the pecuniary distresses of the wife and the friend who were
hospitably entertaining him under their roof: she hastened from a scene so painful, and
joining her father and his brothers, took the arm of her uncle Charles, while the
transported and exulting Margaret was accompanied home by Sir Charles Sefton. ------In airy vision rapt,
She stray'd, regardless whither. THOMSON. THE ardent sun of a bright summer's morning had arisen with more than common
warmth, and the over-joyed birds were loudly tuning their morning carols, when a rude
and violent tumult completely drowned not only their melodious notes, but also the soft
and amorous whisperings of Sir Charles Sefton. Presently whirled aloft over their heads, a large black tea-kettle; and Sir Charles,
though almost ready to expire with his suppressed inclination to laugh, uttered, as he
clasped the terrified Margaret to his breast, "Heaven defend us from the incantations of
that witch!" "Good God, sir," replied Margaret, "has Mrs. Kennedy then followed us? I left her at
the bottom of the stairs which led to her chamber, and she wished me a good-night, as she
told me a violent head-ach had obliged her to take 'French leave,' I think she called it, 'of
the company.'" "Art, art, my dear girl," said Sir Charles, "be assured, from me, who will never
deceive you, she is no better than a witch; and I will one day convince you of it. What
could cause an inanimate tea-kettle to fly about in the air like a bird, except witchcraft
and art magic?" They now walked on a brisk pace before the rest of the party; and Mr. Marsham
stayed behind, to enquire at the cottage, on the other side of the lane they had just passed
through, and from whence the wrangling noise had proceeded, the cause of this early
disturbance! He there found a stout peasant in a violent rage with his wife, for not only
drinking her confounded outlandish slop herself, but also making her children as fond of
it as she was: and that his eldest lads, who were old enough to be fellow-labourers with
himself, he could never get out to work of a morning, till forsooth, they had gotten their
tea! He had sworn the night before, and religiously had he kept his word, that if ever he
found the great tea-kettle on in the morning, except, mayhap on a Sunday, he would
throw it headlong to the d--l; and when he came from the field, at half-past six
o'clock, where he had been anxiously waiting the arrival of his boys, he found his wife in
the act of putting it on the fire, and his eldest son with the bellows in his hand preparing
to make it boil. He snatched it off with a torrent of abuse, unmindful of his wife's and children's
intreaties, and threw it with such violence, that it seemingly took a flight in the air for
some distance, before it gravitated to the earth. Fortunately the water was cold, otherwise
our party from the ball might have been much endangered by the scalding shower. Sir Charles refused to enter Eglantine farm-house, but gave a deep sigh when he
parted from Margaret; while the first object she encountered was Phelim O'Gurphy, who


came by order of the servant-maid, to ask them if they would not be after taking a dish of
coffee? "Or, mayhap," said he, in a half whisper to the young ladies, "you would both like
better a raking pot of tea* ?" Margaret not attending to his words, only hung down her head, and endeavoured to
blush at the consciousness of her infidelity towards this young nobleman; for Sir Charles,
really noble, as far as birth and title made him so, had supplanted this ideal son of
greatness in the place he had heretofore held in her heart. Mary thought Phelim meant by raking tea, only what was uncommonly strong; and
taking Margaret by the arm, thanked him, as she refused it, and accompanied her sister to
their chamber. And now it was Mary's turn to be most wakeful; in vain she darkened the room, in
vain she drew the curtains as close as possible; in spite of all her self-reproaches, or all
the remonstrances of prudence, the figure of Frederic Harrington swam before her fancy,
occupied all her thoughts, and the certain conviction of being so deceived in the opinion
she had first formed of him, brought the vainly represt tear to her waking eyes. Margaret, elated and happy, certain in her own mind that she was now becoming a
heroine of high renown, that not only Phelim O'Gurphy, but also a valiant knight wore
her chains, that all Romance was real, and that great adventures awaited her, soon sunk
into a profound repose, from which she did not awake till two in the afternoon. Mary had long left her pillow, and opening the curtain just as Margaret awoke, she
said, "Indeed, my dear girl, I believe you were born for the scenes of high life; never did I
see you in such spirits as you were in yesterday; and never did I know you sleep so
sound." Margaret caught her hand, and looked earnestly in her face. "Good heavens," thought
she to herself, "conviction has flashed on the mind of my sister! But I will be silent at
present, Sir Charles requested me to be so, and says he has his reasons. "What is the hour,
Mary?" said she;-"Past two, my love," said her amiable sister, "and I have a nice
breakfast prepared for you, which I would not touch till you rose, and which only we shall
take together, for my father and uncles have had theirs; they are now gone out to take a
walk to refresh themselves, and have kindly ordered the servants not to have our dinner
ready till five, as uncle Ralph says, for this late scene of pleasure we must lose two days. My dear father said, 'Ah! my child, how many days are lost by the great and affluent, in
the pursuit of what they falsely call pleasure!'" Margaret hastily dressed herself, and as they took their breakfast, said, "We have an
holiday to-day, and I shall devote it-" "To reading, I know," interrupted her sister. "Now
you happen, Mary, to be mistaken; but I shall not tell any one how I mean to pass this
day." For Margaret had become very circumspect and reserved in all her words and
actions, having so often exposed herself to the ridicule of the servants, the reproofs of her
father, and the laughter of her uncles and sister for her absurdities. "As you please," said Mary, "I shall sit up stairs and finish the little cap, which I call
my holiday work, for poor Betty Harwood's seventh child, with which she is now
pregnant. "-"Very well," says Margaret, "then, my dear Mary, we shall not disturb each

meaning of Phelim, by a raking pot of tea! otherwise we refer our readers for an explanation, to Miss
Edgeworth's excellent novel of CASTLE RACK-RENT. other; first I shall go to the little cottages on the right, and then, full of "conscious
rectitude," I shall devote the rest of the day to that purpose for which I have long
wished." "Will you pardon me, my love, if I say one thing to you," said Mary, "on the subject
of your visits to the cottages?" Margaret, who was all good-humour, replied, "Any thing
you please, my dear Mary, for I am sure you do not mean to offend." "Well then, I must say, my dear, that though all benevolence is amiable, and that it is
better to relieve twenty we may think imposters, than accidentally pass over one found
among them who may be really a worthy object, yet I think you are too indiscriminate in
your charities: the woman, to whom you are so lavish of what little money you are
allowed, who lives in the cottage with the broken window, we know is both idle and
given to drinking; and her window still remains broken, though my uncle Ralph and
Charles have, each of them, given her money more than once to have it mended: then how
many gowns have I given her, both of my own and some that were my mother's! she only
sells them to buy liquor, and is always the same dirty ragged figure; therefore, I now
never give her any thing, for kindness to such an individual is only thrown away. But you
still continue her patroness, and she flatters you by saying, that you are the only worthy
member of the family; and do you see, with all that is given to her, though she has only
herself to provide for, that she is a bit cleaner or better looking; while poor Betty
Harwood, with her six children, is, as well as them, always cheerful, always clean and
industrious: to do any thing for her, is a real charity." "Aye, very well," said Margaret, "I do not like Betty Harwood, she often presumes to
give me advice, and tells me to rise early of a morning, and not read so much; oh! she has
such a common mind, I cannot endure her: while my poor woman has had a very tolerable
education, and she can talk upon some novels she has read, with as much judgement (I
could almost say) as myself!" After this self-applauding sally, Margaret rose, and repaired to the cottages, where
she gossipped with the slatternly object of her beneficence till it was near the hour of five;
and hearing, on her return home, that her father and uncles were going the next day to
dine with a party of gentlemen and farmers, she delayed the important business she had in
contemplation till the morrow, when she should be free from interruption. Situated at about forty miles distance from London, in the county of Essex, stood
Eglantine farm-house, the property of Mr. Ralph Marsham: the mansion was a very
ancient edifice, was lofty, spacious, and consisted of a great variety of apartments; some
of the large ones on the upper story had been chiefly appropriated to store-rooms for oats,
straw, and the winter fruits of walnuts, apples, pears, &c. &c.
In the summer, when the stores were exhausted, the keys were generally left in the
doors of these rooms till they were again replenished. What the farm-house had been formerly, was a matter of doubt; some thought it had
been one of the palaces belonging to one or other of those kings who reigned after the
conquest; while others, with more probability, believed it to have been, for many
generations, a large inn: it came into the family of the Marshams by being purchased by
the grandfather of the present three brothers. In several rooms there were, however, strong marks of antiquity; and in many places
it was proved, in spite of the strength of the building, by their frequent want of repairs. In


two or three of the apartments, were rudely-carved and clumsy figures of shields, in a
kind of basso-relievo on the painted wainscoat; and over several of the chimney-pieces
were arched niches, in which were crosses, old Romish bishops with their crosiers;-
friars, some headless, some armless, with mutilated rosaries. Margaret was sure her uncle's dwelling had been a formidable castle, and that it was
also haunted; for, one night, some friends having arrived from London, she was obliged
to give up the chamber in which her sister and herself reposed, and sleep in one directly
under one of the store-rooms; from whence she heard noises resembling the galloping of
horses without shoes, accompanied with dreadful moanings; which proceeded from no
other cause than what is very common in such old houses, which was an army of rats,
who had encamped there, and were scampering over her head, and essaying to escape
from a terrier which Mr. Marsham kept for the sole purpose of destroying such hostile
enemies to his grain and fruit: while the moans she heard were from a cat, who having
found her way thither, was swearing at the terrier, to prevent his approaching her. But Margaret was fully convinced that the noises she heard proceeded from the
perturbed spirit of some one on whom some fatal deed had been perpetrated; perhaps the
spirit of some of her noble and warlike ancestors stalked about to "render night hideous:"
and as she always read of her favourite heroines despising fear, and investigating
minutely all that bore the appearance of mystery, she resolved, some day, when her father
and uncles would not be likely to interrupt her, she would begin her search, and address
the immaterial and awful being. Perhaps, too, even if the spirit should not reveal itself to her, she yet might be able to
find, in some hitherto concealed recess, the papers which contained the elucidation of her
birth, when the confessions of her guilty nurse, and all the direful scene of her iniquity
would be proclaimed to the astonished inhabitants of the farm-house. As the brothers had some miles to go, they departed early; and Mary and Margaret
had the whole day before them: they had not sat long together before they received an
invitation from a kind neighbour, to pass the day with them, as Messrs. Marshams had
called, and said they were alone. This invitation Margaret positively refused to accept; but
at the same time, strenuously urged her sister to go.
