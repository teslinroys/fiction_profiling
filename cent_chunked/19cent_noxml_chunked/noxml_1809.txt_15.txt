lovely and beloved Clarissa!" asked Walwyn; "why not repeat to his
entranced ear, in music all thine own, in all the polished harmony of numbers, those thrilling
sounds which now have reached my heart!" "The awkwardness of our respective situations, the distance-"
"But all futile distinctions you justly condemn," said Walwyn; "and I glory in the
liberality which you have displayed; I justly count it as your first distinction. Then why, oh! lovely and beloved Clarissa! why have recourse to further explanations? Have courage to
contemn all the forms and the foolish punctilios of the world. You have not hesitated to avow
your preference; be generous, and reward your happy lover! Kill me not at the moment you have
raised such delightful hopes; but say that you will be mine immediately, and our union shall be
as private as your modesty can wish; only say that you consent, and my whole life shall be spent
in showing my gratitude for your goodness!" "Mr. Walwyn!" said Miss Moreton, "I scarcely understand the nature of your address! Is
it possible that you can have made a mistake, as to the object on whom I have placed my
affections? or is your friendship for him of so sanguine a nature, as to make you appear as if you
were pleading your own passion rather than his?" Walwyn hastily arose from his beseeching posture; his cheek was crimsoned, as he stood
rather awkwardly, awaiting the explanation of the fair recumbent. "Montgomery!" cried Miss
Moreton. "Tell me, Sir, where is he? That I may on paper pour out my whole heart to the beloved
of my soul!" "Heaven sure sent letters for some wretch's aid,
"Some captive lover, or some banish'd maid!" "Where is your friend, Mr. Walwyn? Where is my Montgomery? In what sad solitary
spot does he wear away the tedious hours of absence?" "Madam, I do not know;" said Walwyn; "but surely it is ungenerous thus to trifle with my
feelings; it is inhuman, Miss Moreton, thus to sport with your victim. Oh! Clarissa, dearest,
sweetest, Clarissa! be merciful as you are lovely!" and he snatched her hand, and pressed it to his
lips. "Mr. Walwyn! what part of my behaviour has led you to suppose I had the smallest
partiality in your favour, except what friendship might lay claim to?" And the Corinna withdrew
her hand, and fixed her eyes on his truly mortified countenance. "What part? Every part!" cried
Walwyn, with indignant sullenness. "What brought you here, Madam, if you did not mean to
make me believe that you loved me?" "As a friend; as a lively companion, to amuse my comic hours; and as one who could cull
the tragic page for more sublime relaxations, I countenanced and received you; but for my heart
of heart's companion, Oh! Montgomery! Montgomery! I could never turn traitor to thee!" "Good God!" said Walwyn, "you really amaze me, Miss Moreton; the lengths you have
gone in pursuing me; your introducing yourself uncalled, unlooked for, at my barracks, was a
step without precedent; and nothing but the excess of affection, and our speedy union can justify
you to the world, or save your character from public degradation." "Oh! Man! Man! this is thy gratitude!" apostrophized Miss Moreton. "Hear him, ye
powers of benevolence, he reproaches me for my kindness to himself! Mr. Walwyn, I know not
which to admire the most, your consummate vanity, or matchless ingratitude; but fare you well,
Sir! from this moment I disdain to hold any further intercourse with you. To avoid your presence
I would fly to the Antipodes! Go, Sir! leave the room, I charge you, and send Miss Cuthbert to
me. This neighbourhood no longer retains us both. And as you, a gallant warrior, cannot absent
yourself from the post of honour, which your country has (ignorant of your coward qualities)
bestowed on you, I leave the place." "And is it possible that you can be serious, Miss Moreton? Hear me, for your own sake,
hear me!" but Miss Moreton, rang the bell violently, and then wrapped her face in the bedclothes. Walwyn found it useless to try to appease her wrath; and he left the room, muttering a
string of curses, "not loud but deep," as he went down stairs. "Heard you that agonizing throe? "Sure this is not romantic woe!" LANGHORNE. MISS MORETON had sent for Mary Cuthbert, but no Mary Cuthbert appeared. Rather angry at
this inattention, the impetuous heroine re-essayed her bell with additional violence. Alas! poor
Mary heard it not; for, on leaving Miss Moreton's apartment, a faint sickness had overcome her,
and she was found extended on the floor in her chamber, bereft of sense and motion. Medical assistance was sent for; and the physician, who had attended Miss Moreton, was
soon at the side of Mary. With looks of undissembled concern, he felt her pulse and observed her
symptoms; and, asking to be shewn to Miss Moreton's room, he instantly gave it, as his
unequivocal opinion, that Miss Cuthbert was really seized with an alarming and dangerous fever,
and that in all probability she had taken it at the barracks. On hearing this intelligence, unmindful of Doctor Saville's presence, Miss Moreton
began to look about her for her cloths, in order to array herself. He respected the enthusiasm of
her feelings, which made her forget appearances in the contemplation of her young friend's
illness; but his own were speedily experiencing something not very remote from horror, when he
heard Miss Moreton order a chaise, that she might immediately leave the house.-"I cannot
answer for myself, if I witness the illness of my poor Eleve," said she to the Doctor; "on your
care, Sir, I shall confidently rely; you have already rescued me from the jaws of the grave, to
which the same cruel disorder had hurried me; my constitution could not brook a relapse, in the
midst of the tumult which would oppress my anxious soul; and since tis "hard to combat," I must
"learn to fly." "Here, Sir, is a small return for your attention to me; and assure yourself that, if you save
the life of my friend, you shall not go unrewarded!" Dr. Saville took five guineas of the twenty which Miss Moreton offered him.-"This,
Madam, amply repays me for my attendance on you; and assure yourself, that every exertion
shall be used on my part to save your interesting companion.-I know not that I have ever seen a
young creature for whom I have taken such a sudden prepossession as I have towards her; there
is such gentle modesty in her manner-such
-"
"Had you not better send off your prescription, Sir," coolly asked Miss Moreton, "than
thus to indulge in the sanguine description of feelings, which do not well accord with your age or
appearance?" "I have done that already, Madam," said Dr. Saville, with great easiness of manner; "I
have not lost my memory, or my reflection; and though I will do every thing for Miss Cuthbert
which lies in my power, yet I must hint that, lying as she now does at an inn, she requires an
experienced and an attentive nurse; a great deal-all, indeed, depends on attention, and the
regularly administering of the medicines I shall prescribe." "Leave that to me, Sir, leave that to me," said Miss Moreton, "I shall provide every thing
necessary previous to my quitting H--." Dr. Saville quitted the room not much better pleased than was Captain Walwyn, when he
had received his dismissal; but the good Doctor whistled off his spleen, and told Mrs. Saville
when he went home to dinner, on no account to teach his girls the words sentiment or feeling. Miss Moreton, immediately on the departure of the sensible physician, wrote the
following note, and dispatched a messenger with it to H-- barracks, and then discharging her
bill at the inn, she got into a post chaise, and set off no one knew whither, without once looking
in on the still insensible Mary.-
"To Lesley Walsingham, Esq. H-- barracks. "DEAR SIR,
"The baseness and ingratitude of him, whom I once called friend, forces me to apply to
you on the present imperious occasion.-My poor proteg�e and el�ve, Mary Cuthbert, has taken
the virulent infection of your frightful barrack-fever, from nursing me in the disorder, and now is
extended on a sick bed-a stranger in a strange place.-I call upon you to afford her every
assistance which her situation demands from a man of honour and of sentiment! mine imposes
on me far different claims; and it is required of me to lengthen the period of my destiny, by
flying immediately from this pestilential atmosphere! On Dr. Saville as a medical attendant I
confidently rely.-For a nurse, and a compassionate companion, I look to Captain Walsingham;
and my skill in physiognomy tells me I shall not look in vain. I inclose a bill of fifty pounds to
defray all incidental expences; and, as a proof of my confidence and of my friendship, I need say
no more, than that I depute Captain Walsingham to the guardianship of Mary Cuthbert! CORINNA MORETON." "P.S. Expect to hear from me again when the tumultuous emotions of my soul are a little
subsided, and I have acquired resolution to sit down and collect my thoughts!" Words cannot express the surprize of Lesly Walsingham on receiving this note; but his
surprize was not unmixed with concern. He had been much interested for the youthful and lovely
Mary; it was he who had forced her from the infectious room, the moment he had found that she
had sought shelter in it; but he had been too late, for she was visited by the disease. Unaccountable as was the general conduct and deportment of Miss Moreton, there was
something so very inconsistent in her throwing the care of Miss Cuthbert on him, that he could
scarcely believe the evidence of his senses, and in some trepidation he sought Walwyn, to see if
he could give any probable reason for so extraordinary a proceeding. Walwyn was too much disconcerted at the unexpected rebuff he had received, to have a
good word to say of Miss Moreton; and yet he did not like to acquaint Captain Walsingham with
all that had passed between them. Affecting a laugh, he said, "My friend, I give you joy; you are enlisted in the service, but
hang me if it be not worse than an Egyptian one. I have washed my hands of her, and will never
pay her any attention again; for the slightest civility she construes into a mark of particular
attachment, and absolutely persecutes every man with her addresses on whom she casts an
eye.-You are now in for it," shaking Walsingham by the hand; "I wish you well out of it again. But the poor girl, who is lying ill, she really deserves your attention; and, as you are a man of
known benevolence, I think seriously now, I think, Walsingham, Miss Moreton could not have
deputed a more suitable man to perform the nurse's office!" "Her application to me is most singular," said Walsingham; "and though it be in some
measure accounted for by her having broken with you-" "By my having broken with her, if you
please, good Sir," interrupted Walwyn. "Well, though it may be partly accounted for in this way,
yet, surely, a female would have been far more proper to have selected for such a charge." "You do not like to be considered as an old woman," said Walwyn, jestingly. "I feel
myself awkwardly situated," said Walsingham, "and by no means in a humour for jesting. With
regard to catching the disorder, I have not the smallest fear; but for me to enter the sick room of
Miss Cuthbert, is wholly improper; and I have already seen enough of her to know, that I should
offend her modesty by so doing.-And yet, how shall I execute the charge which is designated to
me, if I stay away? How shall I be assured that she receives every attention and care which her
situation demands?" "On Dr. Saville you may confidently rely," said Walwyn; "he is a clever and an
experienced man, and if the life of Miss Cuthbert can be saved, he will leave no means
unessayed." "If," repeated Walsingham, and he heaved a deep sigh as he turned away from Walwyn,
and left the apartment to proceed to --. Our readers probably recollect Lesly Walsingham for the lover of Clara Davenport. He
had not forgotten the amiable Clara; and though time had in some measure weakened the
influence of her charms, it had not rendered Walsingham an happier man. He had plunged into
dissipation to drive away the image of Miss Davenport; but it pursued him in his most retired
moments, and painted the "compunctious visitings of conscience!" From the midnight revel and
the unhallowed pursuit, he had frequently looked back on the peaceful cottage at Heathfield, and
the pure spirit which presided there; and he had wished himself a convert to those precepts and
that actuating principle which formed the rule of her conduct, and was the guiding star of her
life.-But the wish only of being a convert to her opinions had yet been his; and this inefficient
movement of the soul, though sincere at a moment when the disappointments of the world, the
futility of his pursuits, or the emptiness of his enjoyments pressed on his imagination, was soon
stilled in the intercourse of society; and, immersed in new pleasures, he forgot his former
longings after immortality. With regard to the general tenor of his actions, Lesly Walsingham was considered a man
of strict honour and probity.-He was generally respected; his acquaintance was courted; and the
charms of his conversation, and the graces of his manner, obtained him universal suffrage. He
had never thought of marriage since he had been refused by Miss Davenport; and he had not
again felt himself particularly interested, till his eyes had fallen on Mary Cuthbert-an orphan,
dependent entirely on Miss Moreton, as he understood her to be, and now thrown in so unheard
of a manner on his protection; an entire stranger.-His heart beat tumultuously.-It might now
be in his power, by a series of the most delicate, the most undeviating attentions, to make an
interest for himself in her gentle breast-to win the heart of this attractive and ingenuous maiden.
