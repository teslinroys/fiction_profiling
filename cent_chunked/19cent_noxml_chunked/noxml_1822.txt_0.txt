It must be allowed in the world, that a man who has thrice reached the
highest station of life in his line, has a good right to set forth the
particulars of the discretion and prudence by which he lifted himself so
far above the ordinaries of his day and generation; indeed, the
generality of mankind may claim this as a duty; for the conduct of public
men, as it has been often wisely said, is a species of public property,
and their rules and observances have in all ages been considered things
of a national concernment. I have therefore well weighed the importance
it may be of to posterity, to know by what means I have thrice been made
an instrument to represent the supreme power and authority of Majesty in
the royal burgh of Gudetown, and how I deported myself in that honour and
dignity, so much to the satisfaction of my superiors in the state and
commonwealth of the land, to say little of the great respect in which I
was held by the townsfolk, and far less of the terror that I was to evil-
doers. But not to be over circumstantial, I propose to confine this
history of my life to the public portion thereof, on the which account I
will take up the beginning at the crisis when I first entered into
business, after having served more than a year above my time, with the
late Mr Thomas Remnant, than whom there was not a more creditable man in
the burgh; and he died in the possession of the functionaries and
faculties of town-treasurer, much respected by all acquainted with his
orderly and discreet qualities. Mr Remnant was, in his younger years, when the growth of luxury and
prosperity had not come to such a head as it has done since, a tailor
that went out to the houses of the adjacent lairds and country gentry,
whereby he got an inkling of the policy of the world, that could not have
been gathered in any other way by a man of his station and degree of
life. In process of time he came to be in a settled way, and when I was
bound 'prentice to him, he had three regular journeymen and a cloth shop. It was therefore not so much for learning the tailoring, as to get an
insight in the conformity between the traffic of the shop and the board
that I was bound to him, being destined by my parents for the profession
appertaining to the former, and to conjoin thereto something of the
mercery and haberdashery: my uncle, that had been a sutler in the army
along with General Wolfe, who made a conquest of Quebec, having left me a
legacy of three hundred pounds because I was called after him, the which
legacy was a consideration for to set me up in due season in some genteel
business. Accordingly, as I have narrated, when I had passed a year over my
'prenticeship with Mr Remnant, I took up the corner shop at the Cross,
facing the Tolbooth; and having had it adorned in a befitting manner,
about a month before the summer fair thereafter, I opened it on that day,
with an excellent assortment of goods, the best, both for taste and
variety, that had ever been seen in the burgh of Gudetown; and the winter
following, finding by my books that I was in a way to do so, I married my
wife: she was daughter to Mrs Broderip, who kept the head inn in Irville,
and by whose death, in the fall of the next year, we got a nest egg,
that, without a vain pretension, I may say we have not failed to lay
upon, and clock to some purpose. Being thus settled in a shop and in life, I soon found that I had a part
to perform in the public world; but I looked warily about me before
casting my nets, and therefore I laid myself out rather to be entreated
than to ask; for I had often heard Mr Remnant observe, that the nature of
man could not abide to see a neighbour taking place and preferment of his
own accord. I therefore assumed a coothy and obliging demeanour towards
my customers and the community in general; and sometimes even with the
very beggars I found a jocose saying as well received as a bawbee,
although naturally I dinna think I was ever what could be called a funny
man, but only just as ye would say a thought ajee in that way. Howsever,
I soon became, both by habit and repute, a man of popularity in the town,
in so much that it was a shrewd saying of old James Alpha, the
bookseller, that "mair gude jokes were cracked ilka day in James Pawkie's
shop, than in Thomas Curl, the barber's, on a Saturday night." I could plainly discern that the prudent conduct which I had adopted
towards the public was gradually growing into effect. Disputative
neighbours made me their referee, and I became, as it were, an oracle
that was better than the law, in so much that I settled their
controversies without the expense that attends the same. But what
convinced me more than any other thing that the line I pursued was
verging towards a satisfactory result, was, that the elderly folk that
came into the shop to talk over the news of the day, and to rehearse the
diverse uncos, both of a national and a domestic nature, used to call me
bailie and my lord; the which jocular derision was as a symptom and
foretaste within their spirits of what I was ordained to be. Thus was I
encouraged, by little and little, together with a sharp remarking of the
inclination and bent of men's minds, to entertain the hope and assurance
of rising to the top of all the town, as this book maketh manifest, and
the incidents thereof will certificate. Nothing particular, however, came to pass, till my wife lay in of her
second bairn, our daughter Sarah; at the christening of whom, among
divers friends and relations, forbye the minister, we had my father's
cousin, Mr Alexander Clues, that was then deacon convener, and a man of
great potency in his way, and possessed of an influence in the
town-council of which he was well worthy, being a person of good
discernment, and well versed in matters appertaining to the guildry. Mr
Clues, as we were mellowing over the toddy bowl, said, that by and by the
council would be looking to me to fill up the first gap that might happen
therein; and Dr Swapkirk, the then minister, who had officiated on the
occasion, observed, that it was a thing that, in the course of nature,
could not miss to be, for I had all the douce demeanour and sagacity
which it behoved a magistrate to possess. But I cannily replied, though
I was right contented to hear this, that I had no time for governing, and
it would be more for the advantage of the commonwealth to look for the
counselling of an older head than mine, happen when a vacancy might in
the town-council. In this conjuncture of our discoursing, Mrs Pawkie, my wife, who was
sitting by the fireside in her easy chair, with a cod at her head, for
she had what was called a sore time o't, said:--

"Na, na, gudeman, ye need na be sae mim; every body kens, and I ken too,
that ye're ettling at the magistracy. It's as plain as a pikestaff,
gudeman, and I'll no let ye rest if ye dinna mak me a bailie's wife or a'
be done"--

I was not ill pleased to hear Mrs Pawkie so spiritful; but I replied,

"Dinna try to stretch your arm, gude-wife, further than your sleeve will
let you; we maun ca'canny mony a day yet before we think of dignities." The which speech, in a way of implication, made Deacon Clues to
understand that I would not absolutely refuse an honour thrust upon me,
while it maintained an outward show of humility and moderation. There was, however, a gleg old carlin among the gossips then present, one
Mrs Sprowl, the widow of a deceased magistrate, and she cried out aloud:--

"Deacon Clues, Deacon Clues, I redd you no to believe a word that Mr
Pawkie's saying, for that was the very way my friend that's no more laid
himself out to be fleeched to tak what he was greenan for; so get him
intill the council when ye can: we a' ken he'll be a credit to the
place," and "so here's to the health of Bailie Pawkie that is to be,"
cried Mrs Sprowl. All present pledged her in the toast, by which we had
a wonderful share of diversion. Nothing, however, immediately rose out
of this, but it set men's minds a-barming and working; so that, before
there was any vacancy in the council, I was considered in a manner as the
natural successor to the first of the counsellors that might happen to
depart this life. In the course of the summer following the baptism, of which I have
rehearsed the particulars in the foregoing chapter, Bailie Mucklehose
happened to die, and as he was a man long and well respected, he had a
great funeral. All the rooms in his house were filled with company; and
it so fell out that, in the confusion, there was neither minister nor
elder to give the blessing sent into that wherein I was, by which, when
Mr Shavings the wright, with his men, came in with the service of bread
and wine as usual, there was a demur, and one after another of those
present was asked to say grace; but none of them being exercised in
public prayer, all declined, when Mr Shavings said to me, "Mr Pawkie, I
hope ye'll no refuse." I had seen in the process, that not a few of the declinations were more
out of the awkward shame of blateness, than any inherent modesty of
nature, or diffidence of talent; so, without making a phrase about the
matter, I said the grace, and in such a manner that I could see it made
an impression. Mr Shavings was at that time deacon of the wrights, and
being well pleased with my conduct on this occasion, when he, the same
night, met the craft, he spoke of it in a commendable manner; and as I
understood thereafter, it was thought by them that the council could not
do better than make choice of me to the vacancy. In short, not to spin
out the thread of my narration beyond necessity, let it here suffice to
be known, that I was chosen into the council, partly by the strong
handling of Deacon Shavings, and the instrumentality of other friends and
well-wishers, and not a little by the moderation and prudence with which
I had been secretly ettling at the honour. Having thus reached to a seat in the council, I discerned that it behoved
me to act with circumspection, in order to gain a discreet dominion over
the same, and to rule without being felt, which is the great mystery of
policy. With this intent, I, for some time, took no active part in the
deliberations, but listened, with the doors of my understanding set wide
to the wall, and the windows of my foresight all open; so that, in
process of time, I became acquainted with the inner man of the
counsellors, and could make a guess, no far short of the probability, as
to what they would be at, when they were jooking and wising in a round-
about manner to accomplish their own several wills and purposes. I soon
thereby discovered, that although it was the custom to deduce reasons
from out the interests of the community, for the divers means and
measures that they wanted to bring to a bearing for their own particular
behoof, yet this was not often very cleverly done, and the cloven foot of
self-interest was now and then to be seen aneath the robe of public
principle. I had, therefore, but a straightforward course to pursue, in
order to overcome all their wiles and devices, the which was to make the
interests of the community, in truth and sincerity, the end and object of
my study, and never to step aside from it for any immediate speciality of
profit to myself. Upon this, I have endeavoured to walk with a constancy
of sobriety; and although I have, to a certainty, reaped advantage both
in my own person and that of my family, no man living can accuse me of
having bent any single thing pertaining to the town and public, from the
natural uprightness of its integrity, in order to serve my own private
ends. It was, however, sometime before an occasion came to pass, wherein I
could bring my knowledge and observations to operate in any effectual
manner towards a reformation in the management of the burgh; indeed, I
saw that no good could be done until I had subdued the two great
factions, into which it may be said the council was then divided; the one
party being strong for those of the king's government of ministers, and
the other no less vehement on the side of their adversaries. I,
therefore, without saying a syllable to any body anent the same, girded
myself for the undertaking, and with an earnest spirit put my shoulder to
the wheel, and never desisted in my endeavours, till I had got the cart
up the brae, and the whole council reduced into a proper state of
subjection to the will and pleasure of his majesty, whose deputies and
agents I have ever considered all inferior magistrates to be,
administering and exercising, as they do, their power and authority in
his royal name. The ways and means, however, by which this was brought to pass, supply
matter for another chapter; and after this, it is not my intent to say
any thing more concerning my principles and opinions, but only to show
forth the course and current of things proceeding out of the affairs, in
which I was so called to form a part requiring no small endeavour and
diligence. When, as is related in the foregoing chapter, I had nourished my
knowledge of the council into maturity, I began to cast about for the
means of exercising the same towards a satisfactory issue. But in this I
found a great difficulty, arising from the policy and conduct of Mr
Andrew M'Lucre, who had a sort of infeftment, as may be said, of the
office of dean of guild, having for many years been allowed to intromit
and manage the same; by which, as was insinuated by his adversaries, no
little grist came to his mill. For it had happened from a very ancient
date, as far back, I have heard, as the time of Queen Anne, when the
union of the kingdoms was brought to a bearing, that the dean of guild
among us, for some reason or another, had the upper hand in the setting
and granting of tacks of the town lands, in the doing of which it was
jealoused that the predecessors of Mr M'Lucre, no to say an ill word of
him, honest man, got their loofs creeshed with something that might be
called agrassum, or rather, a gratis gift. It therefore seemed to me
that there was a necessity for some reformation in the office, and I
foresaw that the same would never be accomplished, unless I could get Mr
M'Lucre wised out of it, and myself appointed his successor. But in this
lay the obstacle; for every thing anent the office was, as it were, in
his custody, and it was well known that he had an interest in keeping by
that which, in vulgar parlance, is called nine points of the law. However, both for the public good and a convenience to myself, I was
resolved to get a finger in the dean of guild's fat pie, especially as I
foresaw that, in the course of three or four years, some of the best
tacks would run out, and it would be a great thing to the magistrate that
might have the disposal of the new ones. Therefore, without seeming to
have any foresight concerning the lands that were coming on to be out of
lease, I set myself to constrain Mr M'Lucre to give up the guildry, as it
were, of his own free-will; and what helped me well to this, was a rumour
that came down from London, that there was to be a dissolution of the
parliament. The same day that this news reached the town, I was standing at my shop-
door, between dinner and tea-time. It was a fine sunny summer afternoon. Standing under the blessed influence of the time by myself at my shop-
door, who should I see passing along the crown of the causey, but Mr
M'Lucre himself and with a countenance knotted with care, little in
unison with the sultry indolence of that sunny day. "Whar awa sae fast, dean o' guild?" quo' I to him; and he stopped his
wide stepping, for he was a long spare man, and looting in his gait. "I'm just," said he, "taking a step to the provost's, to learn the
particulars of thir great news--for, as we are to hae the casting vote in
the next election, there's no saying the good it may bring to us all gin
we manage it wi' discretion." I reflected the while of a minute before I made any reply, and then I
said--

"It would hae nae doubt of the matter, Mr M'Lucre, could it be brought
about to get you chosen for the delegate; but I fear, as ye are only dean
of guild this year, that's no to be accomplished; and really, without the
like of you, our borough, in the contest, may be driven to the wall." "Contest!"
