I dare say that puritan will
answer for me, if you ask her; or rather that she will tell it you the first time she sees you;
for surely the spirit will move her to tell of so uncomely an action." "It will never move Miss Davenport to say any thing which will give another
uneasiness," said Mrs. Deborah; "and she has too much respect for my family, to hurt the
reputation of one of its members!" "My dear aunt, my reputation is perfectly safe, believe me; though I cannot but be
wonderfully indebted to you, for the prodigious fuss you make about it." "You obliged to me, indeed! Ah Clary, Clary, I wish you meant what you said, for
then you might pay a little more attention to my advice. Indeed, indeed, child, you are
going the very way in the world to be the general talk!" A pleased expression on Miss
Moreton's countenance seemed to infer that this was precisely what she aimed at, as,
turning to her aunt, she said, "Dear Madam, you must be surely complimenting me!" "I
say, complimenting," said Mrs. Deborah; "I believe there are few persons who would
accuse me of complimenting-If I can do any good, by advice and by plain speaking, I
am very ready; but as to complimentary, fawning civility, 'tis Frenchified, and finical, and
I hate it! What's become of the Chevalier, and the fidler, and your Italian Madam?" "All safe at the Villa, my dear Madam, thank your kind inquiries; which I will not
neglect to repeat to them." "My inquiries, niece, extended just as far, as to know if you had sent them a
packing yet, and this is the only information with respect to them, which could give me
any kind of satisfaction. How long do you intend to maintain them?" "Maintain them? what a question! Oh! Madam, when will you learn to expand
your ideas, and dilate your mind?" "When I become the tool of the whole world, and call myself a Sentimental
Philosopher," said Mrs. Deborah, and turning up her lip, and frowning with acrimonious
severity; "I would not care, if the fidler, the squaller, and the whiner were to hear me this
minute; for I speak my mind, when I say, I think they are not proper associates for a
young woman, and that they are a disgrace to you!" Miss Moreton rose from her reclining posture; and, making a mock curtesy, was
leaving the room-"O, stop a minute," cried Mrs. Deborah, "I will put on my hat and
cloak, and go with you; I intended to dine at the Villa to-day, if you had not come, and
now I can have a seat in the carriage!" "If you please, Ma'am, I will let it return again for you," said Miss Moreton; "for
you must recollect, that I have already two companions, and that I always engross one of
the seats myself." "Pray, Mrs. Moreton, take my seat, and suffer me to walk to the Villa," said
Montgomery. "Or me," said Mary, with earnest simplicity. "Neither of you shall stir an inch for me," said Mrs. Deborah. "Oh! by no means," said Miss Moreton. "No, no, we will see if you can't for once sit upright, like a human being," said
Mrs. Deborah. "I will be your supporter!" "What! in that odious red damask, Ma'am? You will give me a fever fit!" "Perhaps it may do you good, child," said Mrs. Deborah, pinning up the train of
her gown, with great non chalance; and, having put on her hat and cloak, and made a
curtesy to her niece and Mary Cuthbert, saying, "I will follow you ladies," she accepted
the proffered civility of Montgomery, and held by his arm, as she walked to the door,
where the carriage was in waiting. The respectful politeness of his manner seemed to have some effect on Miss
Moreton; for she suffered her aunt to take her seat very quietly, and, putting Mary
Cuthbert by her, she got into the vehicle herself, and, notwithstanding that Montgomery
several times requested to be allowed to walk, she insisted on his sitting next her. "I am glad you are coming to the Villa to-day, Ma'am," said Miss Moreton,
addressing Mrs. Deborah; "as, perhaps, the Signora may be in tune to give us a song; and
she is going to leave the Villa very soon, and the dear Monsieur likewise; they are
engaged to attend a music-meeting at Lord --. I am sure I think myself in high luck, to
have retained them so long; for they are in general requisition in the musical world." "Now that's what I think so very improper in the customs of the present day," said
Mrs. Deborah; "every thing is carried to an excess, and music in particular, as if that word
was an incantation, which bound up every sense but hearing." "Music has charms to soothe a savage breast,
"To soften rocks, and bend the knotted oak!" said Miss Moreton, in the true pathos of tragedy. "It seems, indeed, to be a magical art," said Mrs. Deborah, "and to have the power
of transforming every thing. The difference of rank, and the different classes of society,
are entirely overlooked in the pursuit of this tweedledum and tweedledee; and my lord is
to be seen walking, arm in arm, with his fiddler; a bishop has been known to sing Goosygander
with a shoe-black, if he had but a voice; and a young lady is on terms of intimacy
with an abandoned courtezan, merely because she can pitch her pipe to an Italian bravura. What the world will come to at last, I know not; for it is not that people are fonder of
music than they were formerly, when the 'Dusty Miller,' 'Farewell Manchester,' and
'Lady Coventry's Minuet,' were as much as a young lady, in your station," addressing
herself to her niece, "was expected to know of it; and these good old tunes she kept
herself in constant practice of, by playing them on her spinnet at least once a week." "Charming, charming!" said Miss Moreton. "You really, my dear Madam, draw a
most accurate description of the taste and the talents of your century. The spinnet, the
hurdy-gurdy, and the jew's harp! what an harmonious combination of sounds!" "You may laugh, Miss Clary Moreton, but every thing was done decently and in
order in those days. There was some method, some regularity, let me say, some modesty
observed; a young woman would as soon have thought of flying to the moon, as of asking
two profligate foreigners to come and stay in her house, merely because they could squall
and squeak." "What words for expressing the most celestial melody," said Miss Moreton. "I do not stop to consider my words, when I am speaking my mind," said Mrs.
Deborah; "and I am heartily glad that you are likely to be rid of two such disgraceful

inmates; their shameful intimacy is very generally spoken of; and I have been told that
they live like man and wife, even at your house, and I believe you can't deny it." The whole countenance of Mary Cuthbert was suffused by crimson at this coarse
speech of Mrs. Deborah Moreton, but more so at the disgraceful information which it
contained; and, without daring to look at Miss Moreton, she painfully waited to hear a
refutation of the charges which were brought against her favourites. Montgomery looked at the prospect; whilst, with the greatest sang froid, Miss
Moreton said, "Dear Madam, I never troubled myself as to the exact nature of the
intimacy which subsisted between these souls of harmony; but, if to live like man and
wife, is to have a perfect concordance of sentiment, of similarity of idea, and of unison of
taste, then most certainly, do the Signora and the Monsieur resemble a united couple; then
have you paid the highest possible panegyric to the married state, for it must be a state of
undisturbed harmony and love!" Mrs. Deborah lifted up her hands and eyes, and heaving a bitter sigh, she said,
"this comes of my brother's giving you what, poor infatuated man! he called liberal
notions!" "It does, Madam," said Miss Moreton; "I must ever honour the memory of that
parent who saved me from the narrow opinions, and the circumscribed and illiberal
notions of most of my sex; who, valuing themselves on one single virtue, give reins to all
the acrimonious spleen, with which their minds are fraught." The landau, at this moment, drove up to the door of the Villa; Montgomery
handed out the ladies; Mary was the last who wanted his assistance; but he held out his
hand in a mechanical distrait manner, and hurried to the shrubbery; where, flinging
himself on a rustic chair, he gave loose to reflections the most painful. All the pride of his
soul was roused at the idea of staying longer the guest of a woman, whose principles and
whose conduct he held in such low estimation as he did Miss Moreton's. The blunt
speeches of Mrs. Deborah Moreton had wounded him to the quick. Might she not have
asked him when he meant to leave the Villa; and had he even the excuse of scraping the
fiddle to allege as a reason of his stay? Must he not be classed with the herd of Miss
Moreton's sycophantic dependants? and could his visit be interpreted into any thing else,
than a design on her person and fortune? No! he would leave the Villa the next day; he would fly from a place which had
afforded him uneasiness instead of entertainment; he would offer up prayers for the
happiness of Mary Cuthbert, and then try to forget that such a being existed. But of all created beings, the gentle Mary seemed the one whom Montgomery was
the least likely to forget. There was such a touching sweetness in every thing she said;
such a blended look of intelligence and of timidity, that he should continually bear her
image in his mind's eye, and not want the talents of a Copy to pourtray it on canvass!-
He must leave-he must go to-morrow;-but that to-morrow was Sunday, and to travel
on a Sabbath-day was what Montgomery had never done, so of necessity he must remain
one day longer at the Attic Villa. He did not take into his calculation the practicability of walking over to Coventry
the next morning, and of spending the Sunday, both publicly and privately, in an
observance of its duties; he reasoned a little sophistically on the subject, it must be
allowed; but which of my female readers will refuse to plead for him? Montgomery determined, however, on leaving the Villa on Monday; and, having
dressed himself, sought the company in the Lyceum, where, as usual, in stately effect, as
Censor-General of the group, sat Mrs. Deborah Moreton. The Monsieur was trying his cat-gut, and squeaking it, and tuning it, most
scientifically (but not very harmoniously) at her ear; at every shrill tone, the old lady's
brow became more deeply indented, but she observed an inquisitorial silence, as though
something might escape her observation, if a word issued from her mouth. The Signora lounged negligently on a sofa, with her fat and naked back turned
towards Mrs. Deborah Moreton; Mary Cuthbert, in a corner, was quietly pursuing her
netting; whilst the mistress of the mansion, as if determined to redouble her civility to
Signora Grosera, after the conversation which had passed between herself and Mrs.
Deborah Moreton in the morning, said, "Dear Signora, I shall be quite au de despoir,
when you and the Monsieur leave the Villa; I shall pant for your society, for your soulsubduing
strains, which touch the heart to rapture and to love!" "You do us ver great tres honneur," said Monsieur, bowing, grinning, and taking
more than half the compliment to himself and his Cremona; "we shall often, ver
frequently, talk of de plaisir, de felicit� ve both enjoy at de Villa Attic-shall we not, Ma
Signora?" The Signora gave an assenting nod and smile; for the trouble of conversation was
too much for her, and she generally gave up her sex's prerogative to the officious
Monsieur. The rest of the gentlemen soon entered the room; the pensive Chevalier seemed
not to have recovered the disappointment of the morning; his sighs and his looks, when
turned towards Miss Moreton, were evidently intended to upbraid her with cruelty. Not so
Walwyn;-his light heart soon forgot a transient mortification, and, with renovated spirits
and hilarity, he addressed Miss Moreton. The day went off much as the preceding one had done; Montgomery kept his
ground in the good graces of Mrs. Deborah, by again officiating as chaplain at table; and
Mary retained her's by the undeviating modesty and sweetness of her behaviour. At the accustomed hour Mrs. Deborah got up to leave the room; and in the exact
precision which she had observed the evening before, Montgomery attending her to the
door. Mary Cuthbert saw that she was considered as a perfect cypher by Miss Moreton;
this did not hurt her, for Mary had no undue ideas of her own importance; and she felt
that her sentiments were so little in accordance with Miss Moreton's, that it were better
that she should withhold them, than to excite useless argument and disputation, from
which the peaceful breast of Mary recoiled. But Mary had her doubts, whether a residence at the Attic Villa would be
compatible with female delicacy and propriety; yet where, and to whom, could she go? Could she at once act in direct opposition to the will of her father?-a will so binding in
its injunctions, so express in this point, that in Miss Moreton's hands were already placed
the few hundreds which were to form her future subsistence, and which she had orders
not to relinquish, till Mary should attain the age of twenty-one, or should marry. Mary found that it would require much forbearance and fortitude, to sustain her
present situation; but there was something consolatory in the approbation which would

follow her good conduct; and the words which had fallen from Montgomery on this
subject sounded yet sweetly in her ears. The Signora and the Monsieur were going from the Villa; they might not renew
their visit for some time. If the Chevalier D'Aubert would but take his leave also, Mary
would feel more comfortable; for the knowledge which she had unexpectedly obtained of
his character, made her feel an unconquerable repugnance towards him. "It is difficult to say, whether the instrumental
duties of religion, as they are usually termed,
have been more misrepresented by superstition and
hypocrisy on one hand, or by vicious refinement
and vain philosophy on the other. By the former
they have been extolled, as if they were the whole
of religion; while the latter have decried them as
vulgar, unavailing, and insignificant." FORDYCE. SUNDAY morning arrived. The inhabitants of the Attic Villa appeared to hold it in
general observance, by keeping their apartments an hour or two later than usual. And this
observance extended even to the domestics; for when, at nine o'clock, Mary descended
into the little apartment, where she had usually sat when alone, she found it just as it had
been left the preceding day; and presently the house-maid appeared, rubbing her eyes, and
saying, "Lord bless'ee, Miss, I didn't think as how you would be up yet, as 'twas
Sunday." "That was the very reason which impelled me," said Mary; "I thought I would
walk to Mrs. Deborah Moreton's, and go to church with her, if Miss Moreton does not go
herself." "Oh no, Miss Moreton never goes," said the maid; "she doesn't much hold with
church-going; and the company as visits here be most of 'em Meetingers and Romans, I
believe, for they never goes none of 'em to church." "But surely the servants go," said Mary. "Law, Miss, how can us? Now think if
the family is all of 'em in bed, how is it possible to be done?" "But in the afternoon?" "Why, Miss, just as evening prayers goes in, cook must set about getting her
dinner; and we be well worked all of us in the week; and we likes a little rest one day in
seven; though, for my pertickler part, I should have no objections to go to church once a
day myself, for I'm a church of England, born and bred to it all my life; I don't hold with
the Methodists at all." "You appear to be a zealous church-woman," said Mary; "but if you never enter
its sacred walls, I fear the mere profession of religion will not avail." "Oh! I ben't at all fond of Professions, Quakers, nor Floss-all-overs, nor
Byterians, I stand fast by the Church, and always will to the last!" "As one of its outside props," thought Mary, who found it was useless to try to
argue with such unparallelled ignorance. "Alas!" sighed she, "if such only were its
supporters, how soon would the venerable fabric fall; but firm is its foundation, for it
rests on the Rock of Ages!" Mrs. Deborah Moreton's house was very near the parish church. Having taken her
solitary breakfast, Mary set out to call upon the old lady, and to ask her leave to
accompany her to it. Mrs. Deborah Moreton received her young visitor with much
formality; but good humour might easily be discovered under her ceremonious politeness;

and though her manners were reserved, and her appearance stiff, yet her words were in
direct contradiction to them. "You did right, child," said she, "to make your escape from the tents of
ungodliness, to visit the house of your God! I shall always be happy to see you; the family
pew is large enough-too large," said she, lifting up her hands and eyes, "for I only make
use of it. Miss Moreton never comes; she lives without God in the world!"
