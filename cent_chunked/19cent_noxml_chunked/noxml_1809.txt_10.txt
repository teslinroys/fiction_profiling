The marriage settlements were made; the day was fixed; and the lover was
all hilarity and transport. Thrown off his guard by the impetuous emotions of happiness which he
felt, he gave the reins to his sportive imagination; and, conversing amongst a party assembled at
the Cottage, let fall some expressions which Miss Davenport thought wholly irreconcileable with
a belief in the Christian revelation. She had too much prudent consideration to notice this at the moment; but Walsingham's
words had impressed her mind, and stirred up an uneasy sensation there, which an explanation
with her lover only could remove. That explanation came! Too sincere, and too candid to
dissemble or conceal his sentiments; what was the horror of the amiable Clara, when she found
that the object of her fondest affections was a professed disciple of the new school of philosophy,
and a disbeliever of Christianity! To cease to love Lesly Walsingham, was impossible. To make him her convert, was now
the sanguine wish of her heart; but, obstinate in error, proud in fancied knowledge and sceptical
opinions, he resisted all her fond, her pious arguments, and received her last farewell! It was only the comforts of religion, and the sweet consciousness of having acted with
propriety, which could have reconciled Miss Davenport to this great disappointment. She nobly
took upon herself the stigma of the world, declaring that she had broken off the match; and not
assigning the reason, that the character of Walsingham might receive no injury from the
discovery of his sentiments, and hoping that the day would yet come, which would behold him
abjure his dangerous errors. Walsingham was honest enough to give the real reason of their
separation. But few people credited his story, as the "religious creed of a husband was of so little
consequence in the matrimonial connection, that all the ladies were sure this was only the
ostensible cause of Miss Davenport, and supposed that she had seen somebody whom she liked
better, which was a very fair reason for breaking off with the Captain." But time rolling on, and no new lover being received at Heathfield Cottage, it was at
length decreed, nem. con. that "Miss Davenport loved her liberty and independence, and meant
to live and die in single blessedness!" And this did appear very likely; for Miss Davenport would never suffer a declaration of
love since she had discarded Captain Walsingham. Disappointed, so cruelly disappointed in the
object of her youthful affections, her heart did not seem inclined to "own another lord." And, in
the active duties of life, in extensive benevolence, in social and frequent intercourse with a few
estimable friends, she evinced that disappointment had not soured her disposition, although it
had obscured her prospects. Mrs. Deborah Moreton had always been on intimate terms with the Davenport family;
and whilst she loved her niece from a feeling of relative affinity, her affection for Miss
Davenport flowed spontaneously from the heart. She would have given worlds (had those been
in her power) to have seen Clarissa Moreton such as Clara Davenport; but, unfortunately, she
mistook the way of bringing this about, for, by praising and applauding Miss Davenport to her
niece, by repeating anecdotes of her charity and active usefulness, of her propriety of conduct,
and economical arrangements, Miss Moreton took yet greater distaste to what she called, "the
sober regulations of common, every day kinds;" and she always acted in direct opposition to
Miss Davenport, merely because her conduct was praised by her aunt Deborah, and held up to
her for a model. When she occasionally met Miss Davenport, she was barely civil to her; never entered
into any thing like conversation, from an idea that Miss Davenport could only have an inferior
understanding, and the most precise and confined notions; while, in her turn, Miss Davenport felt
a timidity and reserve, foreign to her character, when in the presence of Miss Moreton. Miss Moreton made no objection to Mary Cuthbert's spending the day at Heathfield
Cottage; and she was received with the most unaffected hospitality and pleasure by Miss
Davenport. Insensibly the hours stole away in the pleasant and ingenuous interchange of
corresponding sentiments and remarks. With an improved and highly cultivated mind, Miss
Davenport was yet fond of those works of ingenuity and industry, which peculiarly belong to
females; and while Miss Moreton disdained to handle a needle, lest she should depart from the
dignity of her character, and rank only with a mechanical sempstress, Miss Davenport was
always engaged in some piece of useful or entertaining work of invention or fancy; and carefully
concealed that she had pursuits of a higher nature from the eye of common inquiry, lest she
should be thought to have strayed from the path prescribed to her sex. It was impossible to find a pleasanter companion than Clara Davenport; yet it was not her
wit, it was not her vivacity, it was not her language, which was her secret charm; but it was the
indescribable sweetness of her manner, and the good humour and candour with which she
conversed on every subject! The new friends separated, with a promise of meeting frequently. "I do not ask you to
neglect Miss Moreton on my account, my dear girl," said Miss Davenport; "but recollect that
when she is pursuing those pleasures and pursuits which are independent of you, if you find your
time go slowly by, or that your spirits droop, you will always find a welcome reception here; and
that you will afford me great pleasure by your company." "On Miss Moreton's account I am rejoiced at your residence with her; but, prone to be
selfish, on my own I am still more so. I regret the peculiarities of Miss Moreton's character; but I
should hope, that they will never lead her to do any thing flagrantly wrong; and, harsh and
censorious as the world is in most cases inclined to be, it yet makes great allowances for a young
woman placed in her independent situation. Wealth has a great influence on public opinion; and
when youth and beauty are its concomitants, the judgment receives a stronger bias in its favour." Mary Cuthbert returned to the Villa, her heart filled with sentiments of respect and
affection towards Miss Davenport, and with gratitude towards Mrs. Deborah Moreton, for
promoting their intimacy. "A few only can be expected to act alone,
"But millions are formed to follow others." SAUNTERER. NOTHING very material occurred at the Attic Villa for some weeks, except the secession of
Walwyn, who, maugre his love-lorn Romeos, and his gay Lotharios, was obliged to leave the fair
lady of his adoration, and to join his regiment, which was ordered to the barracks, at Horsham in
Sussex; and the absence of his superior officer rendered his immediate return absolutely
necessary. With many a sigh, a vow, and pathetic adieu, he left the Villa, and the entire field open to
the Chevalier; who luckily had, at this period, a most skilful auxiliary in the shape of a French
novel of wonderful celebrity, which had recently issued from the press. Germ intended to hunt butterflies at the Attic Villa, while there was one left on the wing;
as he liked the dainties of Miss Moreton's table much better than the dry collections which he
should most probably "pick clean teeth" over, when he returned to his lodgings in town. Copy, too, had one particular month for going to the metropolis; for, while the town was
empty, he should have no one to sit to him; and he wisely thought, that he might search very far
before he could meet with such good and such cheap accommodations as the Attic Villa; so he
kept his ground. But the painter and the philosopher were too much engrossed by their separate pursuits to
interrupt the Sentimentalists; and Mary Cuthbert was suffered to run about the house like a
domestic animal, or to visit Heathfield Cottage as frequently as she pleased; for Miss Moreton
and the Chevalier D'Aubert could not be interrupted, whilst they were studying Corinna! It was
the very work to suit the taste of Miss Moreton; for though she had neither judgment or
knowledge to appreciate the beauty or the truth of the historical remarks, in which Madam Stael
has certainly displayed great genius and learning; yet her imagination was enamoured of the
character of Corinna. The lengths which she ran in pursuit of Lord Nelville; the fervid passion
which she felt for him; her rejection of all common forms; her enthusiastic disposition; and her
extemporising faculty, were all beheld by Miss Moreton as the reflected image of her own
character. And, when she had read one or two of the improvisatories of Corinna; when the
Chevalier, observing her flushing cheek and flashing eye, had remarked the similarity of her
genius to that of Madam Stael's heroine, and, turning to her, had called her "The Corinna of
England," the sickly brain of Miss Moreton became inflamed, and she resolved to imitate the
inimitable Corinna, whenever opportunities should offer of discovering her genius to the world,
or her passion to Montgomery. Yes, reader! he was still the Lord Nelville of her imagination. And whilst, from his
sombre turn of mind, the pensive cast of his sallow countenance, and his gloomy and reserved
turn, the Chevalier had guessed that in Lord Nelville's character Miss Moreton could have seen
his image alone; she was busily personifying the handsome and interesting Montgomery, and
fancying him as suffering from the pangs of absence, and the uncertainty of his passion, as the
English nobleman had done. Mean while, Mary Cuthbert was in utter ignorance of all that was passing in the mind of
her protectress; but, from her heightened intimacy with the Chevalier, she feared that he was
trying to secure her hand and fortune, and to procure a divorce from his wife. As this was only conjecture, Mary did not mention her fears, even to Miss Davenport,
with whom her intimacy increased, and in whose society she passed many happy hours. She
sometimes thought of Montgomery as of a dear friend; whom it was not likely that she should
soon meet again; and, whilst she heaved a sigh at the idea, a pleasurable sensation stole over her
soul at the recollection of his amiable and endearing qualities. Mrs. Deborah Moreton frequently spent a day at the Attic Villa, and loudly spoke her
mind on the subject of the Chevalier. Seeing all the rest discarded, and that his intimacy
continued, she naturally concluded that he was the gentleman most in favour with her niece; and
she loudly inveighed against the criminality of continuing such a disgraceful intimacy with a
married man, and a Frenchman! The lectures of her aunt had no power over the inflexible Corinna (as she now called
herself), except in making her more attentive; and, to all appearance, more fond of the Chevalier. His vanity was easily persuaded to believe what he hoped; and, if he could once bring Miss
Moreton to consent to give him her hand, a sum of money would soon silence the clamour of his
ci-devant wife, and send her back to her own country again. It has been said, that Miss Moreton's heart had never heaved a sigh but for Montgomery. But the Chevalier's society was pleasing and delightful to her; and, while he marked the course
of sentimental reading, and, with melting pathos, turned each flowing period, he "taught the
young idea how to shoot;" but its attacks were always levelled towards Montgomery! Miss Moreton's model, the heroine on whose character her own was from henceforth to
rest, in order to acquire that acm� of popularity and eclat, which it so eminently deserved, the
Corinna of Italy, had encouraged the addresses of numerous admirers, and had apparently
favoured the pretensions of a train of lovers. The Count, the Marquis, were only the prototypes
of the Chevalier and of Walwyn. And how would the whole soul of Montgomery dissolve in the
full tide of rapture, when he should discover that the soft throbs of affection had been reserved
for him alone; when he should find that the Corinna of England-she, whose talents, and whose
virtues had been borne on the blast of Fame through the extended dominions of Great Britain;
that she had elected him, to be the partner of her fortune and of her glory! In such wild and chimerical rhapsodies did the visionary enthusiast indulge herself, and
pant for the opportunities of discovering her talent as an Improvisatore (though the musical
abilities of Corinna, not keeping pace with her oratorical powers, perhaps this title was
somewhat improperly applied). She practised attitudes and extemporaneous declamation in her
private theatre, with no spectator or hearer save the designing Chevalier, who was frequently
melted into tears at her sublime effusions; and flattered her with such skill, that he led her to
believe, that her talent for extemporary composition surpassed any thing which he had ever heard
of! Mary Cuthbert became every day more enamoured of Miss Davenport's character; and, if
ever she suffered a wish for affluence to escape her contented bosom, it was when she beheld the
noble use which her new friend made of riches. She was the patroness of a Sunday School, and
likewise of a School of Industry; and, while she daily visited her little cheerful scholars in the
week, to inspect their improvement, she never neglected on a Sunday to inquire into their still
more momentous improvement in religious knowledge. And all this was done with so
unconscious an air, with such benignity of manner, and with so little display, that she appeared
as if she had been receiving obligations herself, instead of conferring them. The poor carpenter's family had found a friend in this general benefactress. She had
procured the best medical assistance for the invalid, who was daily mending, and was supplied
with wholesome and nutritious diet from Heathfield Cottage. Two of the children had been taken
into Miss Davenport's schools; and the poor woman received at proper periods those helps which
her distress required. Thus were a whole family lightened of its cares, and relieved from the extreme of penury,
by the timely intervention of a person, with ability to relieve, and a heart ready to succour; and
whilst Sally Jervis poured out blessings on the head of Miss Davenport, she forgot not the kind
visit, and the heart-consoling sympathy of the amiable Miss Cuthbert, who had helped according
to her ability, and whose pious wishes had been so amply fulfilled. Pleased as was Mrs. Deborah Moreton at the intimacy which now subsisted between Miss
Davenport and Mary Cuthbert, she yet had not the satisfaction of seeing, that it had any influence
on the conduct of her niece; and though the frequent visits of Miss Davenport to the Attic Villa
might deceive the world into a belief of her being on close terms of amity with Miss Moreton,
and be advantageous to her in this respect, by giving her the credit of a respectable acquaintance;
yet in no other shape did it appear likely to benefit. Many a useless walk did Mrs. Deborah Moreton take to the Attic Villa, "to tell a piece of
her mind;" but the Chevalier was still in high favour with the lady of the mansion; Corinna in her
hand and in her head, and the unconscious Montgomery in her heart! The absence of this favoured object of her affections; her entire ignorance concerning
him, would have given any other heroine great anxiety; but Miss Moreton had not a doubt with
regard to a reciprocity of sentiment existing between them; and her busy memory was constantly
employed in retracing his behaviour at the Villa; and at every succeeding retrospection, she
became more secure of the heart of her lover, while her vivid imagination as frequently
pourtrayed his hours of solitary meditation; his empassioned addresses to the Moon; and the
tumultuous emotions of his soul, at hearing the fame of her genius and her talent sounded in his
ears; and the exstatic rapture which would be his, when, raised to the very acm� of popularity, at
once admired and adored, she should resign the glorious independence of her situation to make
his fortune, and to become his wife. From these delightful ruminations, Miss Moreton often tore herself to take lessons from
the Chevalier on Sentiment and Platonism, and to improvisatore before him. The Chevalier
declared, that she every day exceeded herself, and that she wanted only a proper opportunity of
displaying her wonderful talent to be followed as a prodigy! Corinna (as she now always termed herself) was now become the complete victim of
vanity; and, seeing every thing that she said or did through this medium, she believed all the
D'Aubert told her, and much more which was whispered in her ear by this subtle deceiver. She
was ever on the watch for an opportunity of displaying herself; her action daily became more
strong and more animated on the most common subjects; her countenance daily acquired a more
daring character (if such an expression be allowable in describing a female), and her manners
became more decided and more energetic. Such was the Corinna of England, when accident first gave her an opportunity of
displaying her oratorical powers in public and to a very numerous audience. "Bare was her throbbing bosom to the gale:
"Loose flow'd her tresses." THOMSON. IT was a fine morning, when Miss Moreton mentioned her intention of taking a drive in the
barouche; and, contrary to her general custom, she invited Mary Cuthbert and Mr. Germ to
accompany her, as well as the Chevalier D'Aubert. Mary would not refuse; for so seldom had
she been of their party, and so frequently had the Chevalier gone t�te-a-t�te with Miss Moreton,
that she very prudently thought it would be serving the character of her protectress to be seen
with her, as frequently as she had an invitation; and, ever happy to benefit another, though in the
remotest way, she readily prepared for the airing. Mr. Germ did not think it politic to refuse the
proffered civility; and the party soon ascended the open barouche, drawn by four horses, with the
drivers in their gayest liveries, and two outriders following. A large bonnet shaded the face of Mary Cuthbert, and a mantle was thrown round her
shoulders. Loose and negligently attired, Miss Moreton's hair was loosely waving over her
forehead, and decorated on the crown of the head by a bunch of bay leaves, which she had
selected from a heap of flowers and evergreens that lay on the corridor table as she passed, (for
flowers were sent there every morning by the gardener, according to his mistress's order, that she
might chuse, as fancy or taste might lead;) the corner of a long veil was carelessly hung at the
back of her head, and shaded her neck and shoulders, while her bosom was bared to the air and
sun, and shaded only by a large parasol of pink persian, which the Chevalier held mutually over
them, and which, though it might give an interesting suffusion to the features of Miss Moreton,
had no apparent effect on the sallow visage of her companion. Mr. Germ wore a large straw hat, which flapped at the ears, and partially obscured the
profile of his face, though his lanthorn jaws were still very apparent, and his large green
spectacles, when illumed by the sun-beam, exhibited some of the prismatic hues of a rainbow. Thus arrayed, the equipage of Miss Moreton was seen passing through the ancient city of
Coventry. Always an object of attraction, she was not surprized at seeing many curious eyes
from doors and windows as she passed; but she presently perceived that an unusual throng
seemed to precede the vehicle, and that with every step the horses took the concourse increased,
till a mob of people, assembled in a narrow street, prevented the drivers from proceeding. Beckoning to one of her outriders, Miss Moreton ordered him to go on, and inquire the
meaning of the tumult, and the confused noise.-The man obeyed, and was presently in the
thickest of the ranks, whilst the horses in the barouche, eager to follow, pawed and snorted, and
could scarcely be reined in by the postillions. Mary Cuthbert was frightened and intimidated, but
she had presence of mind sufficient to conceal her feelings by silence, and, shading her features
more closely by her bonnet, she sat with patient calmness. Miss Moreton seemed to enjoy the
scene; she looked around her, from time to time, with an air of triumphant majesty, her mind
seemed labouring with some hidden meaning, which it was on the point of giving utterance to,
when her servant returned with difficulty through the mob, and said, "'Tis the first day of the
fair, Ma'am, and so the Lady Godiva be a riding about, to make a little bit of diversion for the
people here in Coventry." Miss Moreton leant her cheek upon her hand for a minute, in an attitude of meditation;
and, perceiving that her carriage was now effectually wedged in by the crowd, and that she had
to the full as many followers as her Ladyship: seeing also that the windows of the narrow street
were well lined on each side of her with attentive spectators, she began to think that it would be
highly impolitic to let such an opportunity pass without displaying her rhetorical powers; and
softly whispering to the Chevalier, "I must not let this glorious minute slip," she slowly arose
from her seat in the barouche, and beckoning to her astonished servants, she ordered them to
command silence from the multitude, and to give audience. The trembling and half-fainting
Mary Cuthbert knew not the meaning of what she saw, and began to conceive that a sudden
paroxysm of frenzy had visited the sickly brain of Miss Moreton-Germ stared through his
spectacles; he lifted up his hat, and looked, then on the mob, and then on the lady, as if to ask for
an explanation. Even the Chevalier was at a loss to know in what manner Miss Moreton meant to
proceed; though, after a pause of a moment, and her motioning to him to stand at her side, and to
guard her with the parasol, he guessed that a declamatory harangue was about to ensue,
especially when he found her hand laid on his shoulder with impressive earnestness, as she first
broke silence. Miss Moreton's address began-
"Citizens of Coventry! My Countrymen, attend! "-She spoke these words in a distinct
and loud tone of utterance; her face was fully turned towards the mob, one arm was extended,
and her veil was expanded with it, whilst the other leant on the Chevalier as a pillar of support. Acclamations, huzzas, peals of laughter, "Hear, hear her,-'tis a preachment-silence-
attention!" sounded from all sides. Overcome by affright and emotion, Mary Cuthbert hid her
face in her handkerchief on the shoulder of Germ, and thus, unconsciously, added to the
ludicrous appearance of the scene.-It was impossible for her to have escaped from her situation;
the torrent of people became more strong; the horses grew more restive, and every instant
seemed to threaten mischief and destruction.-With much presence of mind the outriders had
placed themselves on each side of the barouche; and thus, in some measure, the people were kept
from pressing near the sides of the carriage, though many jumped up behind it, in order to be
nearer Miss Moreton, who, nothing daunted, made a graceful bend to the multitude, on hearing
their tumultuous shouts, and then again began her address. The first impulse of surprise having ceased, curiosity was the general feeling,
* "And the quelled thunder died upon the ear" as the Corinna of Coventry again spoke-
"Citizens of Coventry! my countrymen, attend! Accident has led me hither to be a
pleased witness of your spectacle of this day, and of the patriotic enthusiasm which is excited in
your bosoms! Though centuries have rolled by, and have been lost in the lapse of time, since
Leofric, Earl of Mercia, the first Lord of this city, loaded your sires with heavy burthens, and the
fair and illustrious Godiva so nobly signalized herself to loosen the bonds of your ancestors;
gratitude yet lives in your breasts, and you immortalize the memory of your heroine!-Ye
Citizens of Coventry, free men of an ancient city, behold this day another woman speaks! another woman asserts the glorious prerogative of her sex, the bold freedom of thought and of
action, hitherto so exclusively, so unjustly confined to men alone!-People of Coventry, and do I
then behold you sunk to a state of effeminacy and servitude." The cry of "hear, hear, hear her,"
resounded from all quarters; a gentle hissing was faintly distinguished, but it was borne down by
"hear, hear." "People of Coventry! Men! possessed of capacious minds, of soaring genius, of
depth of intellect; how do I behold you engaged? In what manner do I see the energies of youth,
the judgment of manhood, the experience of age, employed?
