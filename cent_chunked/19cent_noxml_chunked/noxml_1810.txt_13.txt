replied she, "he is not
under so dark a cloud but that I can discover him." This she uttered with a vain attempt to
be sprightly; and the vanity of Harrington was gratified at perceiving the evident tremor
of her heart, as her eyes met his: a rapidity of ideas thronged in quick succession upon her
mind, and made her answers to every question that was put to her, vague, and from the
purpose. Hilarity, content, self-approbation, which were the inmates of many a bosom, and
had sat smiling on the outward countenance, had all fled at the appearance of the intruder,
Harrington: the men all envied him, and wished him any where but there; for every lady
was exclaiming, in one general buz of whispers, "What a handsome man!" The general had been content to the utmost with the good humour of his goddess*,
whose superb set of brilliants, and whose guinea-and-a-half bouquet of choice exotics,
had been presented to her by him in the morning, and for which she had amply repaid him
by her bewitching smiles in the evening; she had also declared she would not dance that
night, because his lordship no longer skipped in the train of Terpsichore: no, she preferred
regaling herself with that mental feast, the charms of his conversation! Now he saw her not only delighted with the handsome intrusive guest, but he
heard her say that she would certainly go down a dance or two with him in the course of
the evening: but Lady Isabella's mind was in a state of cruel agitation; she feared, she
hoped, and lamented: she knew that Frederic Harrington had married Mary Marsham; but
on her removal from the quarters she had first occupied with her husband, she knew not
of Mr. Ralph Marsham's fatal accident: the mourning of Harrington was deep; he might,
perhaps, be a widower! she had heard Mrs. Harrington was thought to be consumptive. "Oh! if he was a widower, then was she a wretch indeed; she was married to a man she
began to detest:" then again she thought that Harrington would not dance if he was so
recent a widower. She therefore felt all her hatred return towards Mary, and feared her
superior attractions; but yet she hoped, fondly hoped, he still loved herself: and Frederic
Harrington was sure, at that moment, he loved her ladyship more than any woman he had
* Historique. ever yet seen; he felt all that ardour of fond desire return in her presence, which is so
often dignified by, and mistaken for the pure passion of love; and when she ventured to
ask him after the health of Mrs. Harrington, he stammered out that she was well, blushed
and hung down his head, while he inwardly cursed his precipitate marriage; "This
woman," thought he, "this resplendent beauty, who does honour to a court by her
appearance, might have been mine!" and rashly and guiltily did he mentally vow that she
should be his; for he fancied it impossible to endure life without the possession of her
charming person. About twelve o'clock Major Raymond made his appearance; he was much altered
in person for the worse, and wore the evident marks on his countenance of severe
embarrassment; his mien was altogether dejected, and his spirits forced; he advanced
towards the proud Frederic with a freedom which that gentleman by no means approved,
who never much liked Major Raymond, and who now felt for him every symptom of
hatred, particularly for his being the legal possessor of the fair enchantress who sat beside
him. Lady Isabella Raymond, from her pecuniary embarrassments, had been tempted to
listen to the gallant compliments, and receive the pointed attentions of Lord Fenwater*;
whose proverbial munificence was such, to the fair ones he admired, that she flattered
herself it would soon disperse the numerous swarm of creditors who continually assailed
her husband's quarters: but Lady Isabella knew not a fourth part of the extent and
enormity of their claims. Dislike to her, as well as indifference, had taken place in the Major's bosom of all
that violent and ardent affection he had once felt for her; and he winked at the too
palpable attachment of the General; partook, with a blind connivance, of all the festivities
given in honour of his wife; encouraged her in accepting the wealthy lover's presents;
drank copiously of the rare foreign wines with which the General supplied his cellar;
while a speedy* promotion to a lieutenant-colonelcy, through his lordship's interest,
danced, in gay vision, before his eyes. But now the torch of love was kindled again, with
added fire, in the breast of her ladyship, by the fine person of Frederic Harrington; the
electric spark of which beamed from her eyes, and inspired Frederic with mutual passion. Love gave softness and additional animation to one of the most beautiful
countenances in the world; fashion, and native original wit, now emulous only to please,
and wholly free from satire and ill-nature, rendered her conversation irresistible; profound
sense and acquired accomplishments united their seductive force, and Harrington was
more firmly her captive than ever. The General now saw, and left the field to the more fortunate and irresistible
conqueror. A single state, abundant wealth, a person yet handsome, and a title, he knew
would ever give him the power of purchasing beauty in all her most brilliant attractions. Frederic Harrington knew not yet the pecuniary embarrassments of the Raymonds;
and thus, though "feasts and tournaments" might be given, to please the beauteous dame,
yet valuable presents flowed not in so amply as when the more aged lover was the
* Historique. * Historique. * Historique. * Historique. experienced and devoted slave, who, much to the surprise of the Major, had quitted
Cromer in a kind of haughty despair; he soon, however, in the unguarded conduct of his
Isabella and the imprudent Harrington, saw the cause, and was vile enough to resolve to
profit by it. Sorry we are to record, that, though Frederic Harrington had been married scarce
three little months, the fascinations of the syren he unhappily fell in with so wrought on
his wavering disposition, that he became a criminal husband, and Lady Isabella a guilty
wife! In a moment of tender confidence, she revealed to him the burthened state of their
pecuniary affairs: the mind of the mistaken Frederic was horror-struck, and he resolved to
mortgage every acre of his estate sooner than see the woman he loved, almost to idolatry,
in distress: but Major Raymond, knowing the ample fortune of Frederic, gave every
opportunity to the criminal lovers, and meditated more public means of retrieving his
shattered circumstances, and meant to spare the thoughtless Harrington the trouble of so
incumbering his estate. O ye woods! spread your branches apace,
To your deepest recesses I fly;
I would hide with the beasts of the chace,
I would vanish from every eye. -- -- -- -- -- --
Yet my reed shall resound through the grove,
With the same sad compliment it begun:
How he smil'd, and she could not but love,
Was faithless, and she is undone." SHENSTONE. LEAVING the faithless Harrington to his guilty, and as he fondly imagined,
secure pursuit of lawless pleasure, we must revert to the virtuous inhabitants of his
forsaken home, and trace back our history to that period which told near a fortnight after
his departure. Mary, till her Frederic ceased to write to her often, and till a forced kind of
tenderness, and cold expressions in his letters, made her wretched, had been reconciled in
some degree to her state of separation from him she held most dear, and she passed her
hours in cheerful content; while her father's chief occupation was studying politics, and
groaning over the newspapers at the ill success of our continental expeditions. Lord Fenwater, on his departure from Cromer, visited town for a few days; where,
to his surprise, he met Sir Edward Harrington; but he imparted more astonishment to the
mind of Sir Edward, when he informed him that his nephew, from whom he had not
heard for some time, was at Cromer! And when Sir Edward, not without a faint blush,
asked Lord Fenwater, if he, who was such an admirer of female beauty, had seen his
pretty niece? and was told Mr. Harrington was there without her, a degree of indignation
accompanied his wonder, which was by no means lessened by the sly inuendos of the
disappointed peer, who enjoyed the mischief he discovered he had made with a splenetic
malevolence. The heart of Sir Edward Harrington, however education and high birth might have
fed a natural pride of family, was yet goodness itself; and he now felt keenly for the
blooming young creature, whose amiability had often charmed him, and whose virtue he
revered: he wrote to his thoughtless nephew to quit the society of a woman whom he had
ever deemed most unprincipled and dangerous, and an adept in every seductive artifice;
alleging, that he flattered himself his presence would be some inducement for his quick
return, as he meant to finish the summer at his cottage; whither he was going to repair
immediately. The admonitory letter was at first scoffingly thrown on one side; he had not then
possessed the person of his bewitching Isabella; he was on the bright eve of expectation,
and should he quit such a prize, in view, for the insipid caresses of a virtuous wife? Such were the impulsive thoughts of the deluded Frederic; but on cooler reflection
he wrote a flattering answer to his uncle, saying, he should instantly repair home as soon
as ever the physician who attended him would give him leave to quit the sea; then he
would, on the wings of love, fly to his much-loved home, and dearly-revered uncle. Sir Edward, at first, was the dupe of these hyperbolical expressions, but his
silence afterwards, with his constrained letters to his charming wife, made the worthy
baronet dread the worst. How delighted were the good Curate and his daughter at beholding this excellent
man! who advanced, with a sweet cordiality, to embrace his niece, and whom he now
regarded with the fondest paternal interest. He was resolved to make her ample amends
for any coldness he might hitherto have shewn her; and that she should solely occupy that
place in his affections so long held by his worthless nephew. One fine autumnal morning, as he was walking in the romantic and extensive
garden which belonged to the cottage, he listened with enthusiastic pleasure to the most
exquisite voice which had ever met his ear: the air it sung was plaintive, the peculiar
harmony of it was wafted with the morning breeze to the place where he had seated
himself; and Sir Edward, who was passionately fond of music, listened with that mute
attention which dreaded to give way, even to his own respiration, lest it should destroy
one melodious note of a songstress whose warbling seemed almost celestial. The voice seemed to proceed from a little Chinese pavilion near the end of the
garden; Sir Edward rose in order to direct his steps thither; but a servant coming to inform
him that breakfast was ready, prevented him: the servant then turned down another all�e;
the voice soon ceased, and Sir Edward walked slowly to the house; where he found seated
to receive him, at their morning repast, Mr. Marsham and his daughter. "Some spirit of the air surely haunts your gardens," said the baronet, "what vocal
genii preside over the place? the voice of a seraph seemed to regale my ears this morning,
and appeared to proceed from the Chinese pavilion." Edward smiled, while Mary blushed
deeply; but recovering herself, she said, "Oh! Sir Edward, you have lived, I see, too long
in a court; flattery in that hemisphere is natural to you all, for even Sir Edward Harrington
makes use of the destructive ingredient?" "How flattery?" replied Sir Edward; "what, by
saying I thought your cottage-garden attended by genii?" "No, no, Sir Edward," said Mr.
Marsham, "it was my daughter you heard, she was singing a favourite air which Mr.
Harrington taught her; indeed, I believe the words are his own, though set to an old tune." "Your daughter! why I found her at the tea-table when I entered." "Yes," said Mr. Marsham, "she came in, sir, by a nearer way than you did." "Dear
sir," said the embarrassed Mary, "why say any more about it? Sir Edward, I am sure, must
have seen me, and is now only quizzing me." "Pardon me, my love," said Sir Edward,
"you know there is nothing I so much despise as that fashionable propensity: but, pray tell
me, has your charming voice, with so just an ear as I find you possess, never had any
cultivation?" "No, sir," replied Mary, "my father and uncles little thought I should ever
fill the elevated situation I now hold, as the wife of Mr. Harrington, and the
acknowledged niece of Sir Edward: and my husband says I am now too old to learn." A faint blush of indignation tinged the cheek of Sir Edward, and he finished his
breakfast in silence. This displeasure against his once darling Frederic was by no means lessened at
receiving a letter from a sincere friend, a gentleman who was then at Cromer, and
between whom and Sir Edward there had been a friendship existing from their days of
infancy: this friend charged him, if possible, to withdraw his nephew immediately from a
scene of iniquity and destruction; he informed the baronet, that he saw through all the
despicable and unmanly artifice of Major Raymond, with the fascinations and dangerous
principles of Lady Isabella; and that the morals and fortune of Mr. Harrington would be
inevitably ruined by her baneful allurements. Sir Edward, on the receipt of this afflicting intelligence, wrote to his nephew the
most kindly expostulating letter, wherein he made use of every tender and affectionate
persuasion to induce his return to a wife, who not only loved him with virtuous
constancy, but who did honour to his choice: he urged the obligatory necessity of his
breaking those ignominious fetters by which he was now so completely and infamously
bound; expatiated on the dreadful crime of indulging the illicit passion with which he was
inspired; but firmly promised, ere he concluded his letter, that not one reproachful
sentence from him should reach his ear, if he would instantly return. This letter afforded only laughter to him and the gay partner in his guilt; and, by
her advice, he wrote an answer, saying, That he was of age to act, in every respect, as he
pleased; that he was quite weary of the shackles and restraints which an uncle, who could
have no right to act with any authority, had so long laid upon him; that he was determined
henceforth to act and think for himself: he had done every thing in his power to render his
wife and her father independent and happy; and he was sure the present society of his
uncle had much added to their felicity, and must make his own presence more easily
dispensed with: that uncle he should certainly welcome with the most sincere pleasure;
and for that purpose he should come home as soon as it was conducive to his health, or
any other reasons which might keep him where he was; but, that he never would be
restricted; and he must beg to be considered as totally independent in future, and at
liberty, in every respect, to act as he pleased.-By the same post, Mary received a cold
and distant letter from her once kind and tender Frederic. Sir Edward watched the various
emotions of her interesting countenance as she read it; and "Oh!" thought he, "thou shalt
yet triumph!" Once he had an idea of taking the worthy Curate and his daughter, and setting off
to Cromer; "But alas!" thought he, "then perhaps, this new-made wife, almost yet a bride,
may witness the distracting truth of her husband's infidelity! now, in her retirement, we
may succeed in keeping it from her: I will therefore occupy her thoughts, and prepare her
for that splendid station I yet hope to see her fill-the happy and honoured wife of
Frederic Harrington." Without loss of time, and at that highly purchased and profuse expence which his
large fortune enabled him to bestow on her, he sent to London for the most eminent
masters to attend upon Mary; he was resolved, that on her introduction into the great city
next winter, she should outshine her criminal rival in the elegance of her carriage and
manners, and also in those accomplishments to which he knew her divine voice and
wonderfully quick capacity would impart a brilliancy. He told not his niece the extent of her misfortune, but gently hinted to her that
Frederic was a gay young man, too apt to be swayed by the contagion of modern manners:
"Exert yourself, then, my sweet niece," he would say; "study indefatigably the shining
accomplishments I wish you to possess: as you are superior in every virtue of the mind, so
rise, even by trivial accomplishments, above the vain coquettes and gaudy flutterers of the
present hour; the heart of your husband may stray, and be tempted to wander amongst
them; but you will, you shall regain it!" Mary started. "Fear nothing, my Mary," continued he; "I only tell you, the world
you have just entered is beset with danger and temptation of every kind, particularly for
our sex; the labyrinths of fashion are unknown to you; I fear not that you will lose
yourself in them, but I am not without some portion of anxiety on my nephew's account:
born and educated amongst fashion's votaries, he is become one of them, and loves the
fickle goddess too well: to you, the wife of his bosom, the object of his fondest choice,
belongs the glorious task of his reformation. You must perceive, my dear girl," added the
worthy man, while a tear started to his benevolent eyes, "that the reign of romantic
ardour, short as it has been, is at an end. When your husband returns, receive him with
smiling tranquillity; beware equally of rapture as of reproaches; be yourself; be mistress
of your feelings; shew that cheerful spirit which is worthy your virtue; a glorious
conquest will be yours! shame, repentance, and true and lasting reformation his: and yet,
suffer not, my sweet Mary, while you endeavour to deck your face with smiles, the worm
of anguish to prey upon your susceptible heart; for I will venture to answer for Frederic, if
you pursue the line of conduct I have chalked out for you; shew yourself generous and
forbearing; and if vice and fashion do not quite corrupt his heart, you will be happier with
him than if he had never erred; he will never again leave you, nor forsake you." While this excellent man made use of this honest artifice to encourage the hopes
and elevate the spirits of his niece, it was he who felt the "worm of anguish!" Pale,
distressed, his fine form wasted to a shadowy appearance, the inward state of his mind
can be better fancied than pourtrayed: he hoped much from Mary, but he dreaded the
wavering principles of his nephew, to whom he now fancied his former partiality had
been so great as to make him blind to his imperfections, which he, with all the selftormenting
pangs of anxiety, now magnified into a vicious disposition: but Frederic
Harrington was not naturally wicked; he had excellent principles and a feeling heart, but
he had been spoilt by the incense of flattery, and the too evident admiration of the softer
sex; while the gay principles of the present fashionable world were such, as, while they
pleased his senses, ensnared his heart, by fatally deluding his sanguine imagination and
too easy temper. Week after week flitted away, but no kind husband arrived to the expectant Mary,
who attended to her fashionable accomplishments with diligent perseverance: the hope
that Sir Edward held out to her she easily received; her disposition had ever been such as
to look always on the fairest side of life's deluding prospects; and her unwearied
occupations in the day, with her music, dancing, and singing masters, studying Italian
with Sir Edward, who was a proficient in the language, and learning of him, in the
evening, every fashionable game at cards, so employed her, that when she pressed her
pillow an hour before midnight, her sleep was sweet, sound, and unbroken, and she
awoke, each morning, more blooming, more lovely in person than ever. In the mean time, her sister Margaret would have been completely weary of the
splendid kind of vassalage in which she lived with Mrs. Davenport, were it not that
visions of unalterable love occupied all her thoughts from the deceitful protestations dealt
out to her by the libertine, Sir Charles Sefton: he had but lately become acquainted with
the Davenports, and highly admired the bewitching Mrs. Davenport; but the greatest
cause of his admiration of her, was, that she then chanced to be the fashion, and a most
delightful notoriety was attached to him who could be happy enough to be her most
favourite cicisbco. Margaret Marsham, on his entering the drawing-room, the first evening after she
became an inmate of Mr. Davenport's house, trembled and changed countenance, and
was in a state of cruel anxiety, to think that he was the man whom Mrs. Davenport had
professed to love very much, both to her waiting-maid and her confidential friend; for in
Mrs. Davenport, Margaret imagined she had a most formidable rival to contend with,
whose charms, though very bewitching, were yet much heightened in the eyes of
Margaret by the warm principles of gratitude which glowed in her bosom. Sir Charles fixed his eyes on the poor little Eglantine grisette; but he again took
them off without addressing her; though he resolved from that moment to complete the
ruin of her youthful innocence; for lovely as was Mrs. Davenport, he had never felt for
her one spark of desire. He was, indeed, as Mrs. Davenport had told her friend, grown much handsomer;
and though he was fast approaching to that state which in so dissipated a being is
generally hastened, and is far beyond middle age, yet there was a certain air, which so
marked the gentleman, in spite of his defects, and so pleasing and insinuating a smile
embellished his countenance, when he wished to appear amiable, that, together with his
fine speeches and pretended regard, he had really made a conquest over the silly
Margaret, whose desire to have a lover proceeded more from a vain and deluded
imagination than from natural constitution. Her former predilection for Sir Charles she now found return, with renewed
ardour, on thus unexpectedly meeting him: the poisonous effects of romance-reading had
not yet, notwithstanding the variety of life's usual scenes she had lately witnessed, been
eradicated from her mind: and she now, without reflecting how much the members of the
fashionable world unite, and are found together, thought it a most wonderful event that
the first day of her arrival in London she should thus, so unlooked for, behold the object
of her regard; and she felt certain that it was a sure presage of their being united: but,
alas! he seemed to have forgotten her; and was the chosen favourite of a lady whom he
appeared to regard with uncommon interest, and to attend her with the most pointed
gallantry. She caught a glance at herself in a long pier-glass; her thick figure appeared
slimmer in mourning, her face was flushed from agitation, her bugles glittered from the
reflection of numerous wax-lights, and she fondly imagined, that perhaps she was so
much altered for the better, that Sir Charles did not immediately recognise her, and she
was determined, if an opportunity offered, to address him first. It had not yet occurred to her, that perhaps the violent anger of disappointed love,
at her refusing to elope with him from the masquerade, was the cause of his pretending
not to recollect her. "Well, I am a careless creature!" said Mrs. Davenport, with a childish lisp and
giggle; "I forgot, Sir Charles, to introduce my companion to you: Sir Charles Sefton, Miss
Marsham, sister to Mrs. Harrington." Sir Charles Sefton coldly bowed; while Margaret,
with true na�vet�, said, "Oh! ma'am, I have seen Sir Charles Sefton very often before." "Where? child," said Mrs. Davenport, with quickness, not unobservant of a deep sigh and
a kind of reproachful love-glance which the baronet pointed directly to Margaret as she
concluded her artless sentence; who immediately explained, saying she had seen him at
the Leslies', when that family were at Eglantine. Love, particularly that illicit affection which goes by that name, is generally
attended by a damsel in yellow attire, yclept Jealousy: Mrs. Davenport observed some
stolen glances between the baronet and Margaret; she appeared, however, not to notice
them, and turning to Sir Charles, said, "I have invited Mr. Leslie and Lady Caroline to a
rout next week; you have no objection to meet your old acquaintance, I suppose: I have
never heard you even mention them; but I intended to have sent you a card to-morrow." "None, in life," said Sir Charles, colouring; "I do not visit there now, but we
frequently meet." There was a constraint about Sir Charles, and a kind of mystery this evening,
which did not well please Mrs. Davenport; and she was out of humour with him, with
herself, and every one else. Sir Charles, with a desponding look, after numerous efforts to
restore the lady to her usual sprightliness, uttered a pointed philippie against the cruel
caprices of the fair; and darted a most reproachful look at Margaret, which she well
understood, and was now convinced she had found out the cause of his former coldness
towards her. The arrival of some gay young men to supper, who were favourites of Mrs.
Davenport, for that gross incense of flattery which they continually offered at the shrine
of her beauty, gave Sir Charles an opportunity of speaking to Margaret apart. She was so
desirous of being re-instated in his good opinion, and receive again from him looks of
tenderness instead of anger, that she said to him, "La! Sir Charles, I see you are angry; but
I am sure, when my sister was taken so ill, I could not act otherwise than I did on the
night of Mr. Leslie's masquerade, though I had consented to a clandestine marriage with
you." "Marriage!" repeated the baronet; "marriage! my adorable girl? I thought you had
more liberality of sentiment than to think of that certain destroyer of true and lasting love:
look now at the amiable Mrs. Davenport, who married for love; is she happy? look at
Lady Isabella Raymond, who now detests her husband, and he her." "Lady Isabella!" said
Margaret; "ah! where is that dear friend of my heart? that congenial soul with my own!" "I do not know," said the baronet; "we have never met since her marriage; I am told she is
very unhappy; and point me out, if you can, one married pair that is otherwise." "Yes, sir,
my sister. "-"Is she?" continued Sir Charles with a sneer; "I much doubt it: Mr.
Harrington is not the man to make one woman happy long; he was always a professed
libertine, and had he really loved your sister, he would never have married her." "Dear
sir," said Margaret, "what but love could make him marry my sister? she had no fortune,
no accomplishments to entitle her to such a match."-"Nonsense! child," said Sir
Charles, "why the man was under the dominion of a raging fever, quite delirious, I
understand." "No, indeed, sir," said Margaret, "not when he was married." "Married!" echoed Sir Charles, "how I do hate that odious word! Oh! my beloved, my angelic


Margaret, I love you with that refined ardour that assures me I shall love you for ever! and
I could not bear the idea of being obliged to love you because a priest muttered over a few
vows, which vows are poor indeed, to those my heart would make to the charms of your
mind and person! "How can I write to you, my dear girl? we are now observed." He then turned to
the company, but soon found a second opportunity, amidst the buz of fashion, to address
the credulous girl, under pretence of enquiring after some friends in the country. "Beware," said he to her, "of Mrs. Davenport; she is of a very suspicious
disposition; therefore, forgive me, if I am sometimes obliged apparently to take no notice
of you; be assured, at those very moments of seeming neglect, my heart holds sweet
communion with yours: tell me how I can write to you?" "I fear that will be impossible," said Margaret; for she had no friend, or confidante
to whom she could repose so important a trust; and the licentious baronet and the
romantic girl concluded therefore only to watch every opportunity which chance might
offer of plighting to each other their mutual protestations of unalterable and unrestrained
affection. "The Great O's and Macs!" IRISH BALLAD. ------The sons of pleasure flow

THOMPSON. MRS. DAVENPORT, now tortured by all the pangs of jealousy, treated poor
Margaret not only with neglect, but ill-nature: the unfortunate victim of Sir Charles
Sefton's arts bore it with Job-like patience, reflecting on the lot of all the beauteous and
amiable heroines of romance, who were born to encounter difficulties, be the sport of
fortune, and afflicted sufferers, from the caprice of tyrants and jealous friends converted
into foes! As she sat in her dressing-room one morning, contemplating on the happiness of
being the ever-cherished and lasting favourite of the fashionable sultan who admired her,
Mademoiselle Minette (for Margaret had no peculiar maid to wait on her, as was at first
promised) came to her, and said, "that one very odd-looking, petite boule of a man
wanted to speak with her; and ah! mon dieu," continued the soubrette, "qu'il est roux!"
