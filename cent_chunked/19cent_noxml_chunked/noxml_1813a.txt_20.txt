Honest Jerry Sullivan met me at the door, and shook my hand, and danced
round me in a fury of outrageous joy. 'Well,' cried he, 'often and often I thought your freaks would get you
hanged; but may I be hanged if ever I thought they would get you
married!' 'You see,' said I to Stuart, 'after all your pains to prevent me from
imitating romances, you have made me terminate my adventures like a
true romance--in a wedding. Pray with what moral will you now conclude
the book?' 'I will say,' returned he, 'that virtue--no. That calamity--no. That
fortitude and resignation--oh, no! I will say, then, that Tommy Horner
was a bad boy, and would not get plumcake; and that King Pepin was a
good boy, and rode in a golden coach.' Adieu.
